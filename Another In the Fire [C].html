<p> There's a grace, when the heart is under fire</p><br>
<p> Another way when the walls are closing in</p><br>
<p> And when I look at the space between  where I used to be  and this reckoning</p><br>
<p> I know  I will never be  alone</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Chorus 1: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”</big></sup></h3>
<p>There was another  in the fire,  standing  next to me</p><br>
<p>There was another  in the waters,  holding back the seas</p><br>
<p>And should I ever  need reminding  of how I've been set free</p><br>
<p>There is a cross that bears the burden  where another died for me</p><br>
<p>There is another  in the fire</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Interlude 1: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”</big></sup></h3>

<p> All my debt left for dead beneath  the waters</p><br>
<p> I'm no longer  a slave to my sin  any-more</p><br>
<p> And should I fall  in the space between  what remains of me  and this reckoning</p><br>
<p> Either way  I won't bow  to the things  of this  world</p><br>
<p> And I know I will never be  alone</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Chorus 2: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”</big></sup></h3>
<p>There is another  in the fire,  standing next to me</p><br>
<p>There is another  in the waters,  holding back the seas</p><br>
<p>And should I ever  need reminding,  what powers set me free</p><br>
<p>There is a grave that holds no body  now that power lives in me</p><br>
<p>There is another  in the fire</p><br>

<p>And I can see  the  light  in the darkness,  as the darkness bows to Him</p><br>
<p>I can hear  the  roar  in the heavens,  as the space between wears thin</p><br>
<p>I can feel the  ground  shake beneath us,  as the prison walls cave in</p><br>
<p>Nothing stays between us,  nothing stays between us</p><br>

<p> There is no other name, but the name that is Jesus</p><br>
<p> He who was  and still is,  and will be through it all</p><br>
