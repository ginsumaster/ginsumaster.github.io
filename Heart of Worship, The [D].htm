<h3><sup><big>    ————————— Verse 1: ————————————————————————————————————————————————</big></sup></h3>
<h6>D                A                           G</h6><br>
 <p>  When the music fades, and all is stripped away</p><br>
<h6>             Asus  A</h6><br>
 <p>And I simply come</p><br>
<h6>D                 A                          G</h6><br>
 <p>  Longing just to bring, something that's of worth</p><br>
<h6>                     Asus  A</h6><br>
 <p>That will bless Your heart</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    ————————— Pre-Chorus: —————————————————————————————————————————————</big></sup></h3>
<h6>Em                D/F#        A</h6><br>
 <p>   I'll bring You more than a song</p><br>
<h6>                Em               D/F#       A</h6><br>
 <p>For a song in itself is not what You have required</p><br>
<h6>Em                 D/F#       A</h6><br>
 <p>   You search much deeper within</p><br>
<h6>                         Em7                  D/F#    Asus  A</h6><br>
 <p>Through the way things appear, You're looking into my heart</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    ————————— Chorus: —————————————————————————————————————————————————</big></sup></h3>
<h6>D                        AaddB</h6><br>
 <p>  I'm coming back to the heart of worship</p><br>
<h6>         Em        D/F#      G         A6</h6><br>
 <p>And it's all about You, it's all about You Jesus</p><br>
<h6>D                        AaddB</h6><br>
 <p>  I'm sorry Lord for the thing I've made it</p><br>
<h6>          Em        D/F#      G         A6    D</h6><br>
 <p>When it's all about You, it's all about You Jesus</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    ————————— Verse 2: ————————————————————————————————————————————————</big></sup></h3>
<h6>D                 A                     G</h6><br>
 <p>  King of endless worth, no one could express</p><br>
<h6>               Asus  A</h6><br>
 <p>How much You deserve</p><br>
<h6>D                     A                   G</h6><br>
 <p>  Though I'm weak and poor, all I have is Yours</p><br>
<h6>             Asus   A</h6><br>
 <p>Every single breath</p><br>
