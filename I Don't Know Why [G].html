<p> I don't know why Jesus loved me</p><br>
<p> I don't know why He cared</p><br>
<p> I don't know why He sacrified His life</p><br>
<p> Oh, but I'm glad, so glad He did!</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Verse 2: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”</big></sup></h3>
<p> Where would I be if Jesus didn't love me</p><br>
<p> Where would I be if Jesus didn't care?</p><br>
<p> Where would I be if He hadn't sacrified His life</p><br>
<p> Oh, but I'm glad, so glad He did</p><br>
<p> So glad He did, so glad He did!</p><br>

<p> He left His mighty throne in glory</p><br>
<p> To bring to us redemption's story</p><br>
<p> Then He died, but He rose again, just for you and me</p><br>
<p> Oh, but I'm glad, so glad He did!</p><br>
