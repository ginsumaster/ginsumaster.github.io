<h3><sup><big>    â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Verse 1: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”</big></sup></h3>
<p>God sent His Son, they called Him Jesus</p><br>
<p>He came to love, heal and forgive</p><br>
<p>He lived and died, to buy my pardon</p><br>
<p>An empty grave is there to prove my Savior lives</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Chorus: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”</big></sup></h3>
<p>And because He lives, I can face tomorrow</p><br>
<p>Because He lives,  all fear is gone</p><br>
<p>Because I know  He holds the future</p><br>
<p>And life is worth the living, just because He lives</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Verse 2: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”</big></sup></h3>
<p>How sweet to hold, a newborn baby</p><br>
<p>And feel the pride, and joy he gives</p><br>
<p>But greater still, the calm assurance</p><br>
<p>This child can face, uncertain days, because Christ lives</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Verse 3: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”</big></sup></h3>
<p>And then one day, I'll cross that river</p><br>
<p>I'll fight life's final, war with pain</p><br>
<p>And then as death, gives way to vict'ry</p><br>
<p>I'll see the lights, of glory and I'll know, He reigns</p><br>
