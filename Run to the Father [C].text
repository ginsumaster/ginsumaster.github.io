I've carried a burden  for too long on my own
I wasn't created  to bear it alone
I hear Your invitation  to let it all go
I see it now  I'm laying it down  I know that I  need  You

â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Chorus: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”
I run to the Father  I fall into grace  I'm done with the hiding  no reason to wait
My heart needs(found) a surgeon  my soul needs(found) a friend
So I'll run to the Father again and again and again and again

â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Interlude: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”

You saw my condition  had a plan from the start
Your Son for redemption  the price for my heart
I don't have a context  for that kind of love
I don't understand  I can't comprehend  all I know is I  need  You

â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Bridge: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”
My heart has been in  Your  sights  long before my  first  breath
Running into  Your  arms  is running to life  from  death
I feel this rush  deep in my chest  Your mercy is calling out
Just as I am  You pull me in  I know I need You  now

Oh Oh (Oh/)again and again and again
