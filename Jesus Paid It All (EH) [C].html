<h3><sup><big>    ————————— Verse 1: ———————————————————————————————————————————————————</big></sup></h3>
<p>I hear the Savior say, "Thy strength indeed is small.</p><br>
<p>Child of weakness watch and pray. Find in Me thine all in all.""</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    ————————— Chorus: ————————————————————————————————————————————————————</big></sup></h3>
<p>Jesus paid it all; all to Him I owe</p><br>
<p>Sin had left a crimson stain; He washed it white as snow</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    ————————— Verse 2: ———————————————————————————————————————————————————</big></sup></h3>
<p>Lord now indeed I find, Thy power and Thine alone</p><br>
<p>Can change the leper's spots, and melt the heart of stone</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    ————————— Verse 3: ———————————————————————————————————————————————————</big></sup></h3>
<p>For nothing good have I, whereby Thy grace to claim</p><br>
<p>I'll wash my garments white, in the blood of Calvary's Lamb</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    ————————— Verse 4: ———————————————————————————————————————————————————</big></sup></h3>
<p>And when before the throne, I stand in Him complete</p><br>
<p>Jesus died my soul to save, my lips shall still repeat</p><br>
