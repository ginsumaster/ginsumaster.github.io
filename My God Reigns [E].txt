   ————————— Verse 1: ——————————————————————————————————————————
E                             A      E
There's nowhere else that I'd rather be
     A            E          F#m       B
Than dancing with You as You sing over me
E                             A      E
There's nothing else that I'd rather do
A            B       E
Lord than to worship You

   ————————— Bridge: ———————————————————————————————————————————
     E
So rejoice, be glad, rejoice O my soul
For the Lord, your God, He reigns forevermore
    A                 E
I rejoice, for my God reigns
     E
So rejoice, be glad, your Father and your Friend
Is the Lord, your God, whose rule will never end
    A                 E
I rejoice, for my God reigns

   ————————— Chorus: ———————————————————————————————————————————
       B             A                  E
My God reigns, and I dance the dance of praise
       B              A               E
My God reigns, with a shout I will proclaim
       B             A               E
My God reigns, and I worship without shame
       B           A              F#m
My God reigns, and I will rejoice
T:              E
   (For) my God reigns
