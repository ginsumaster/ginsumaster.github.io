<h3><sup><big>    ————————— Chorus: ————————————————————————————————————————————————————</big></sup></h3>
<p>All things bright and beautiful all creatures great and small</p><br>
<p>All things wise and wonderful the Lord God made them all</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    ————————— Verse 1: ———————————————————————————————————————————————————</big></sup></h3>
<p>Each little flower that opens, each little bird that sings</p><br>
<p>He made their glowing colours. He made their tiny wings</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    ————————— Verse 2: ———————————————————————————————————————————————————</big></sup></h3>
<p>The purple headed mountain, the river running by</p><br>
<p>The sunset and the morning, that brightens up the sky</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    ————————— Verse 3: ———————————————————————————————————————————————————</big></sup></h3>
<p>The cold wind in the winter, the pleasant summer sun</p><br>
<p>The ripe fruits in the garden, He made them every one</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    ————————— Verse 4: ———————————————————————————————————————————————————</big></sup></h3>
<p>He gave us eyes to see them, and lips that we might tell</p><br>
<p>How great is God Almighty, who has made all things well</p><br>
