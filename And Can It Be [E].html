<p>And can it be that I should gain an interest in the Savior's blood?</p><br>

<p>He left His Father's throne above, so free so infinite His grace</p><br>
<p>Emptied Himself of all but love, and bled for Adam's helpless race</p><br>
<p>'Tis mercy all, immense and free, for O, my God, it found out me!</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Verse 3: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”</big></sup></h3>

<p>'Tis mystery all the Immortal dies; who can explore His strange design</p><br>
