Follow the star to the place unexpected
Am                                             Dm
Would you believe after all we've projected, a child in a manger
C                                      Am
Lowly and small, the weakest of all  unlikeliest hero

Wrapped in His mother's shawl just a Child, is this who we've waited for

'Cause how many kings stepped down from their thrones
Am
How many lords have abandoned their homes

How many greats have become the least                 for me
    C
And how many gods have poured out their hearts
   Am
To romance a world that has torn all apart

How many fathers gave up their sons for me

Bringing our gifts for the newborn Savior
Am                                         Dm
All that we have whether costly or meek, because we believe
C                                   Am
Gold for His honor and frankincense for
                                                   Dm
His pleasure and myrrh for the cross He'll suffer, do you believe
                                                    Gsus  G
Is this all we've waited for (it's who we've waited for)
