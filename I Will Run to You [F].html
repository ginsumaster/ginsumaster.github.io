<h3><sup><big>    ————————— Verse 1: ———————————————————————————————————————————————————</big></sup></h3>
<p> Your eye is on the sparrow, and Your hand, it comforts me</p><br>
<p> From the ends of the earth to the depths of my heart</p><br>
<p>Let Your mercy and strength be seen</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    ————————— Verse 2: ———————————————————————————————————————————————————</big></sup></h3>
<p> You call me to Your purpose, as angels understand</p><br>
<p> For Your glory, may You draw all men</p><br>
<p>As Your love and grace demands</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    ————————— Chorus: ————————————————————————————————————————————————————</big></sup></h3>
<p>And I will run to You, to Your words of truth</p><br>
<p>Not by might, not by power but by the Spirit of God</p><br>
<p>Yes I will run the race, 'til I see Your face</p><br>
<p>Oh let me live in the glory   of Your grace</p><br>
