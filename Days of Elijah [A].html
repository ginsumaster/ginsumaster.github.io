<h3><sup><big>    â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Verse 1: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”</big></sup></h3>
<p>These are the days of Elijah, declaring the Word of the Lord</p><br>
<p>And these are the days of Your servant, Moses,</p><br>
<p>Righteousness being restored</p><br>
<p>And though these are the days of great trials,</p><br>
<p>Of famine and darkness and sword</p><br>
<p>Still we are the voice in the desert, crying,</p><br>
<p>"Prepare ye the way of the Lord!"</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Chorus: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”</big></sup></h3>
<p>Behold, He comes riding on the clouds</p><br>
<p>Shining like the sun, at the trumpet call</p><br>
<p>So lift your voice; it's the Year of Jubilee</p><br>
<p>And out of Zion's hill salvation comes!</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Verse 2: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”</big></sup></h3>
<p>These are the days of Ezekiel, the dry bones becoming as flesh</p><br>
<p>And these are the days of Your servant, David,</p><br>
<p>Rebuilding a temple of praise</p><br>
<p>These are the days of the harvest,</p><br>
<p>The fields are as white in Your world</p><br>
<p>And we are the labourers in Your vineyard,</p><br>
<p>Declaring the Word of the Lord!</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Bridge: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”</big></sup></h3>
