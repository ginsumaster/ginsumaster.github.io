<p>Sometimes on this journey  I get lost in my mistakes</p><br>
<p>What looks to me like weakness is a canvas for Your strength</p><br>
<p>And my story isn't over  my story's just begun</p><br>
<p>     Failure won't define me  cause that's what my Father does</p><br>
<p>Yeah failure won't define me  cause that's what my Father does</p><br>

<p>Arrival's not the endgame  the journey's where You are</p><br>
<p>You never wanted perfect You just wanted my heart</p><br>
