Alas and did my Savior bleed and did my Sov'reign die?
      D                              Em      A6      D
Would He devote that sacred head for sinners such as I!

   ————————— Chorus: ———————————————————————————————————————————
       D                            A
At the cross, at the cross, where I first saw the light
        G                          D
And the burden of my heart rolled away
       G                  D         Bm
It was there by faith I received my sight
    Em       A             D   G  D
And now I am happy all the day

Was it for crimes that I have done He groaned up-on the tree?
 D                             Em     A6     D
Amazing pity grace unknown and love beyond degree!

Well might the sun in darkness hide and shut His glories in,
     D                                Em      A6         D
When Christ the mighty Maker died for man the creature's sin

     D                                   G  D      G     D  A
Thus might I hide my blushing face while Calvary's cross ap-pears
   D                                  Em        A6      D
Dissolve my heart in thankfulness and melt mine eyes to tears

    D                                  G    D  G    D  A
But drops of grief can ne'er repay the debt of love I  owe:
      D                             Em       A6    D
Here, Lord, I give myself away 'tis all that I can do!
