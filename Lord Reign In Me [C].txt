C    G       F          G        C
Over all the earth, You reign on high
      G        F             G      Am7
Every mountain stream, every sunset sky

Is that You'd reign in me again

Over all my dreams, in my darkest hour
    G       F       G     Dm7
You are the Lord of all I am

So won't You reign in me again

May my life reflect the beauty of my Lord
                G       F           G       Dm7
'Cause You mean more to me than any earthly thing
             F        G   C
So won't You reign in me again
