How deep the Father's love for   us    how vast beyond all mea- sure
     D                  Em  D/F#  G       D/F#              A   D
That He should give His on- ly    Son  to make a wretch His treasure
                      Em  D/F#  G          D/F#             D/A   A
How great the pain of searing   loss   the Father turns His face away
   D                    Em  D/F#  G          D/F#         A  D  G/B  D/A  D  G2
As wounds which mar the Cho-sen   One  bring many sons to glory

Behold the Man upon a     cross          my sin upon His shoulders
 D                Em  D/F#  G                 D/F#          A   D
Ashamed I hear my mocking   voice        call out among the scoffers
                   Em   D/F#  G            D/F#         D/A  A
It was my sin that held Him   there      until it was accom- plished

His dying breath has brought me    life  I know that it is finished

  D                 Em  D/F#  G           D/F#              D/A  A
I will not boast in an- y-    thing    no gifts no pow'r no wis- dom
    D               Em  D/F#  G            D/F#           A  D
But I will boast in Je- sus   Christ   His death and resurrection
                       Em  D/F#  G       D/F#           D/A  A
Why should I gain from His re-   ward  I cannot give an an-  swer
    D                Em  D/F#  G           D/F#                A  D   G/B  D/A  D  G2
But this I know with all my    heart   His wounds have paid my ransom
