   ————————— Verse 1: ——————————————————————————————————————————
    G                           C/G
You did not wait for me to draw near to You
        D/G                   C/G         G  C/D  D
But You clothed Yourself with frail humanity
    G                          C/G
You did not wait for me to cry out to You
        D/G              C/G       D/G  G
But You let me hear Your voice calling  me
