<p>My hope is built on nothing less</p><br>

<p>On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand;</p><br>
<p>All other ground is sinking sand,</p><br>
<p>All other ground is sinking sand.</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Verse 2: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”</big></sup></h3>
<p>When darkness veils His lovely face,</p><br>

<p>In ev'ry high and stormy gale,</p><br>
<p>My anchor holds within the veil.</p><br>

<p>His oath, His covenant, His blood</p><br>

<p>When He shall come with trumpet sound,</p><br>
<p>Oh, may I then in Him be found;</p><br>
<p>Dressed in His righteousness alone,</p><br>
<p>Faultless to stand before the throne.</p><br>
