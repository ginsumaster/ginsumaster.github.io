<p>It's the song of the redeemed, rising from the African plain</p><br>
<p>It's the song of the forgiven, drowning out the Amazon rain</p><br>
<p>The song of Asian believers, filled with God's holy fire</p><br>
<p>It's every tribe every tongue every nation</p><br>
<p>A love song born of a grateful choir</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Chorus: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”</big></sup></h3>

<p>Let it rise above the four winds, caught up in the heavenly sound</p><br>
<p>Let praises echo from the towers of cathedrals</p><br>
<p> To the faithful gathered underground</p><br>
<p>Of all the songs sung from the dawn of creation</p><br>
<p> Some were meant to persist</p><br>
<p>Of all the bells rung from a thousand steeples</p><br>
<p> None rings truer than this</p><br>
<br>

<p>And all the powers of darkness, tremble at what they've just heard</p><br>
<p>'Cause all the powers of darkness, can't drown out a single  word</p><br>
