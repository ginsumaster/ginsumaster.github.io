Alone in my sorrow, and dead in my sin

Lost without hope, with no place to begin
     B                      E2         B
Your love made a way to let mercy come in

My orphan heart was given a name

My mourning grew quiet, my feet rose to dance

When death was arrested, and my life began

You have made me new, now life begins with You

Released from my chains, I'm a prisoner no more
   E2                     F#         G#m7
My shame was a ransom, He faithfully bore
   B                         E2            B
He cancelled my debt, and He called me His friend

When death was arrested, and my life began

    B                     E2         B
Our Savior displayed on a criminal's cross
E2                           F#         G#m7
Darkness rejoiced, as though heaven had lost
         B                     E2         B
But then Jesus arose, with our freedom in hand
            G#m7                    F#        B
That's when death was arrested, and my life began

Yes, we're free,  free,  forever amen
