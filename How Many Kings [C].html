<p>Follow the star to the place unexpected</p><br>
<p>Would you believe after all we've projected, a child in a manger</p><br>
<p>Lowly and small, the weakest of all  unlikeliest hero</p><br>
<p>Wrapped in His mother's shawl just a Child, is this who we've waited for</p><br>
<br>

<p>'Cause how many kings stepped down from their thrones</p><br>
<p>How many lords have abandoned their homes</p><br>
<p>How many greats have become the least  for me</p><br>
<p>And how many gods have poured out their hearts</p><br>
<p>To romance a world that has torn all apart</p><br>
<p>How many fathers gave up their sons for me</p><br>
<br>

<p>Bringing our gifts for the newborn Savior</p><br>
<p>All that we have whether costly or meek, because we believe</p><br>
<p>Gold for His honor and frankincense for</p><br>
<p>His pleasure and myrrh for the cross He'll suffer, do you believe</p><br>
<p>Is this all we've waited for (it's who we've waited for)</p><br>
