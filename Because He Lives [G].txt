             G                    C
God sent His Son, they called Him Jesus
           G                 D
He came to love, heal and forgive
             G               C
He lived and died, to buy my pardon
         G                 D               G
An empty grave is there to prove my Savior lives

And be-cause He lives, I can face tomorrow

Because He lives,          all fear is gone

Be-  cause I    know         He holds the future

And life is     worth the   living, just because He lives

   ————————— Verse 2: ——————————————————————————————————————————
             G               C
How sweet to hold, a newborn baby
             G                 D
And feel the pride, and joy he gives
            G                 C
But greater still, the calm assurance
               G               D                    G
This child can face, uncertain days, because Christ lives

   ————————— Verse 3: ——————————————————————————————————————————
             G                    C
And then one day, I'll cross that river
                  G               D
I'll fight life's final, war with pain
            G                   C
And then as death, gives way to vict'ry
             G                D                 G
I'll see the lights, of glory and I'll know, He reigns
