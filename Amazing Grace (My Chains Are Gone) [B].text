Amazing grace how sweet the sound  that saved a wretch like me
I once was lost but now I'm found  was blind but now I see

â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Verse 2: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”
'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear  and grace my fears relieved
How precious did that grace appear  the hour I first believed

My chains are gone  I've been set free  My God my Savior has ransomed me
And like a flood  His mercy rains  unending love  amazing grace

â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Verse 3: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”

The earth shall soon dissolve like snow  the sun forbear to shine
But God who called me here below  will be forever mine  Will be forever mine
You are forever mine
