    E5                               A2
The wind is beginning to blow, I can feel it, I can feel it.
    E5                               A2
The river is starting to flow, I can hear it, I can hear it.
Bsus                B/A                  Esus  E    C#m
These are the days,     the days of Your pres- ence

Seasons of change,     times of refreshing

   ————————— Chorus: ———————————————————————————————————————————
E        Bsus           A2          E   Esus
Over and over, let Your mercy cover me;
E        Bsus           A2                E
Over and over, let Your river run through me;
C#m     E/B     A2             A2/F#
O, Holy Spirit, pour down like rain;
E        Bsus  A2   E5
Over and over again
