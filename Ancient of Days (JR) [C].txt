Though the na-tions rage  kingdoms rise  and fall

There is still  one king  reigning o-  ver all
     C     Am  G              F      G  Am
So I will  not fear  for this truth  re-mains:

For His throne it shall remain and ever stand
        F              Am           F        G   C
All the power, all the glory I will trust in His name

   For my God is  the Ancient  of Days

Though the dread  of  night  overwhelms my soul
      F          C        Am    G
He is here  with me  I am not  alone
      C     Am  G            F      G  Am

I will watch  and wait  for the Saviour King

In the presence of  the Ancient  of Days
