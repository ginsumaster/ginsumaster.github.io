F#m               E              D             A
Sometimes on this journey  I get lost in my mistakes
     F#m              E             D               A
What looks to me like weakness is a canvas for Your strength

And my story isn't over  my story's just begun
     F#m             E                     D              A
     Failure won't define me  cause that's what my Father does
     F#m             E                     D              A
Yeah failure won't define me  cause that's what my Father does

Check your shame at the door  cause it ain't welcome anymore

Arrival's not the endgame  the journey's where You are
    F#m          E                D         A
You never wanted perfect You just wanted my heart
        F#m         E            D           A
And the story isn't over  if the story isn't good

And failure's never final  when  the Father's in the room
