<h3><sup><big>    ————————— Intro: —————————————————————————————————————————————————————</big></sup></h3>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    ————————— Verse 1: ———————————————————————————————————————————————————</big></sup></h3>
<p>What love my God would bring You down to earth</p><br>
<p>What king would take a low and lonely birth</p><br>
<p>Yet to this dark and broken place You came</p><br>
<p>To sleep beneath the stars that You had made</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    ————————— Turnaround / Outro: ————————————————————————————————————————</big></sup></h3>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    ————————— Verse 2: ———————————————————————————————————————————————————</big></sup></h3>
<p>What love my God would send the Way of Life</p><br>
<p>To walk the road, rejected and despised</p><br>
<p>That You might know the weakness I possess</p><br>
<p>And be my rock of strength and righteousness</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    ————————— Chorus: ————————————————————————————————————————————————————</big></sup></h3>
<p>O Your love my God like a flood</p><br>
<p>As heaven opened up  pouring out on us</p><br>
<p>O praise the King who came to the world</p><br>
<p>In His love like a mighty flood</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    ————————— Verse 3: ———————————————————————————————————————————————————</big></sup></h3>
<p>What love my God could hold You to the tree</p><br>
<p>To bear that overwhelming debt for me</p><br>
<p>The Son of heaven leaves the Father's side</p><br>
<p>The Healer bleeds, the Life was made to die</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    ————————— Verse 4: ———————————————————————————————————————————————————</big></sup></h3>
<p>What love my God, so gracious and extreme</p><br>
<p>Was strong enough to come and fight for me</p><br>
<p>To go through hell and down into the grave</p><br>
<p>And raise me up to see You face to face</p><br>
<p>You raise me up to see You face to face</p><br>
