<p>No eye has seen and no ear has heard,</p><br>
<p>And no mind has ever conceived</p><br>
<p>The glorious things that You have prepared</p><br>
<p>For ev'ryone who has believed;</p><br>
<p>You brought us near and You called us Your own,</p><br>
<p>And made us joint heirs with Your Son</p><br>
<br>

<p>How high and how wide, how deep and how long,</p><br>

<p>How lavish Your grace, how faithful Your ways,</p><br>
<p>How great is Your love, O Lord</p><br>

<h3><sup><big>    â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Verse 2: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”</big></sup></h3>
<p>Objects of mercy, who should have known wrath,</p><br>
<p>We're filled with unspeakable joy,</p><br>
<p>Riches of wisdom unsearchable wealth,</p><br>
<p>And the wonder of knowing Your voice;</p><br>
<p>You are our treasure and our great reward,</p><br>
<p>Our hope and our glorious King</p><br>
