       C/E              F                  G            C
In the darkness we were waiting    without hope without light
          C/E             F                  G             C
Till from heaven You came running  there was mercy in Your eyes

To fulfil the law and prophets     to a virgin came the Word
       C/E               F              G             F
From a throne of endless glory     to a cradle in the dirt

C                  F               Am                Gsus     G
Praise the Father  praise the Son  praise the Spirit three in one

To reveal the kingdom coming    and to reconcile the lost

To redeem the whole creation    You did not despise the cross
    C/E          F                      G            C
For even in Your suffering      You saw to the other side
        C/E             F             G                C
Knowing this was our salvation  Jesus for our sake You died

        Am               F                 G               C
And the morning that You rose       all of heaven held its breath
          Am                  F             G                  C
Till that stone was moved for good  for the Lamb had conquered death
        Am                   F              G               C
And the dead rose from their tombs  and the angels stood in awe
        Am                 F               G            C
For the souls of all who'd come     to the Father are restored

        Am                   F              G              C
And the Church of Christ was born  then the Spirit lit the flame
         Am              F                   G               C
Now this gospel truth of old       shall not kneel shall not faint
       Am               F                 G            C
By His blood and in His Name       in His freedom I am free
        Am            F                    G           C
For the love of Jesus Christ       who has resurrected me
