C  F      F/A  Am  Dm/F  G  C   E7/B  Am        Em    E7      Am
O  sacred Head now wound-   ed, with  grief and shame weighed down
C   F       F/A  Am  Dm/F  G  C   E7/B  Am           Em  E7  Am
Now scornfully   sur-round-   ed, with  thorns Thine on- ly  crown
    G    G/E  F   Dm6  Csus  C      F          Dm       A
How pale Thou art with an-   guish, with sore abuse and scorn
D/F#  G         Am7  G   C6  D  G     C     F/A      F6     G  C
How   does that vis- age lan-   guish which once was bright as morn!

What Thou my Lord hast suf-     fered was   all for sin-ners' gain
C   F    F/A  Am  Dm/F  G   C     E7/B  Am        Em  E7  Am
All mine was  the trans-gression, but   Thine the deadly  pain
   G    G/E  F     Dm6  Csus  C         F   Dm        A
Lo here I    fall, my   Sav-  ior, 'tis I deserve Thy place
D/F#  G     Am7  G   C6  D  G    C  F/A     F6   G   C
Look  on me with Thy fa-    vor; as-sist me with Thy grace

What language shall I   bor      row to    thank Thee dearest Friend,
C   F        F/A  Am  Dm/F  G  C    E7/B  Am   Em  E7  Am
For this Thy dy-  ing sor-     row, Thy   pity without end?
  G    G/E  F     Dm6  Csus  C       F        Dm       A
O make me   Thine for- ev-   er, and should I fainting be,
D/F#  G      Am7  G   C6  D  G  C  F/A     F6   G   C
Lord  let me nev- er, nev-   er outlive my love for Thee
