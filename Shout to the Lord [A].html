<p> My Jesus  my Saviour Lord there is none like  You</p><br>
<p>All of my days I want to praise</p><br>
<p>The wonders of Your mighty love</p><br>
<p> My Comfort  my Shelter Tower of ref-uge and strength</p><br>
<p>Let every breath  all that I am  never cease to worship You</p><br>

<p>Shout to the Lord all the earth let us sing</p><br>
<p>Power and ma-jesty praise to the King</p><br>
<p>Mountains bow down  and the seas will roar  at the sound  of Your name</p><br>
<br>
<p>I sing for joy at the work of your hands</p><br>
<p>Forever I'll love You  forever I'll stand</p><br>
<p>Nothing compares to the pro-mise I have  in   You</p><br>
