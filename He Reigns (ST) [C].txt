         F                     C                       G
It's the song of the redeemed, rising from the African plain
         F                     C                       G
It's the song of the forgiven, drowning out the Amazon rain
            F                C                      G
The song of Asian believers, filled with God's holy fire
                       F
It's every tribe every tongue every nation
  C                            G
A love song born of a grateful choir

   ————————— Chorus: ———————————————————————————————————————————
G
  (it's)(when) All God's children singing
F            C              G
Glory glory, hallelujah, He reigns, He reigns (X2)

   ————————— Verse 2: ——————————————————————————————————————————
       F                          C                         G
Let it rise above the four winds, caught up in the heavenly sound
            F
Let praises echo from the towers of cathedrals
        C                      G
 To the faithful gathered underground
                               F
Of all the songs sung from the dawn of creation
 C                     G
 Some were meant to persist
                             F
Of all the bells rung from a thousand steeples
 C                     G
 None rings truer than this

   ————————— Bridge: ———————————————————————————————————————————
            F                   C                            G
And all the powers of darkness, tremble at what they've just heard
               F                   C                        G
'Cause all the powers of darkness, can't drown out a single   word
