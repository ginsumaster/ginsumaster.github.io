I searched the world,  but it couldn't fill me
Man's empty praise,  and treasures that fade  are never enough

Then You came along  and put me back together
And every desire  is now satisfied,  here in Your love

â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Chorus: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”
Oh there's nothing  better than You,  There's nothing  better than You
Lord there's nothing,  nothing is better than You

I'm not afraid  to show You my weakness
My failures and flaws,  Lord You've seen them all,  and You still call me friend

â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Verse 4: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”
'Cause the God of the mountain  is the God of the valley
There's not a place  Your mercy and grace  won't find me again

You turn shame into glory,  You're the only one who can
