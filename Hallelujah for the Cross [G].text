I would be hopeless  without Your goodness
I would be desperate  without Your love
Slave to the darkness  if it wasn't for the cross

You have won me  with Your kindness
Chased me down when  I was lost
Where would I be  if it wasn't  for  the cross

(Oh) Hallelujah  thank You Jesus
I was a prisoner now I'm not
(Oh 'cause) With Your blood You  bought my freedom
(Oh) Hallelujah for  the cross (oh)

All my shame was  met with mercy
Now Your mercy  will be my song
And oh the glory  oh the power  of  the cross

The pow'r of sin overcome.  It is finished.  It is done
