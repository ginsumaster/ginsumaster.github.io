<p>In humble adoration I kneel before Your throne</p><br>
<p>In brokenness I seek Your face  alone</p><br>
<p>Above You there's no other who's able to restore my soul</p><br>
<p>Come and make me whole</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Chorus: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”</big></sup></h3>

<p>Use me now I pray</p><br>

<p>I will say of the Lord He is my strong tower</p><br>
<p>My Rock and my Fortress in whom I trust</p><br>
<p>In times of the storm and in tribulation</p><br>
<p>He is my help and my salvation</p><br>
<p> (O) Breath of God,  restore my soul</p><br>
<br>

<p>I need Thee, O how I need Thee, ev'ry hour I need Thee</p><br>
<p>O bless me now, my Savior, I come to Thee</p><br>
