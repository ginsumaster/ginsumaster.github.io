   ————————— Verse 1: ——————————————————————————————————————————
G                      C        G           D           G
These are the days of Elijah, declaring the Word of the Lord
    G                          C2
And these are the days of Your servant, Moses,
G             D       G
Righteousness being restored
    Bm                                 Em
And though these are the days of great trials,
   Am         C            D
Of famine and darkness and sword
      G                       C
Still we are the voice in the desert, crying,
    G           D          G
"Prepare ye the way of the Lord!"

   ————————— Chorus: ———————————————————————————————————————————
  D        G                   C
Behold, He comes riding on the clouds
                 G                   D
Shining like the sun, at the trumpet call
             G                           C
So lift your voice; it's the Year of Jubilee
                  G       D      G
And out of Zion's hill salvation comes!

   ————————— Verse 2: ——————————————————————————————————————————
G                      C           G           D         G
These are the days of Ezekiel, the dry bones becoming as flesh
    G                          C2
And these are the days of Your servant, David,
  G          D         G
Rebuilding a temple of praise
Bm                        Em
These are the days of the harvest,
    C             Am            D
The fields are as white in Your world
    G                    C
And we are the labourers in Your vineyard,
  G          D             G
Declaring the  Word of the Lord!

G                              C
  There's no god like Jehovah!   There's no god like Jehovah!
G                              D
  There's no god like Jehovah!   There's no god like Jehovah!
