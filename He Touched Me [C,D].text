Shackled by a heavy burden
'Neath a load of guilt and shame
Then the hand of Jesus touched me
And now I am no longer the same

And oh, the joy that floods my soul
Something, happened, and now I know
He touched me and made me whole

Since He cleansed and made me whole
I will never cease to praise Him
I'll shout it while eternity rolls
