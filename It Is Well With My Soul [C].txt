Whatever my lot, Thou has taught me to say,

It is well, it is well, with my soul.

Let this blest assur-  ance control,
     C            F         Dm         G

And hath shed His own blood for my soul.

Is nailed to the cross, and I bear it no more,

Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul!

If Jordan above  me shall roll,

Thou wilt whisper Thy peace to my soul.

The sky, not the grave, is our goal;

The clouds be rolled back  as a scroll;
    C             F              Dm           G
The trump shall resound, and the Lord shall descend,

Even so, it is well with my soul.
