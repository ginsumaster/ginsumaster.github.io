   ————————— Verse 1: ——————————————————————————————————————————
       C#m          B           F#m     A    B  C#m
I have made You too small in my eyes, O Lord forgive me
    C#m      B           F#m       A          B       C#m
And I have believed in a lie  that You were unable to help me
    E      B       F#m    A      A       B         C#m7
But now, O Lord, I see my wrong  heal my heart and show Yourself strong
E         B        F#m   A       A        B    C#m     A        B    E
And in my eyes and in my song  O Lord, be magnified, O Lord, be magnified

   E    B       F#m   A         E              Bsus  B
Be magnified, O Lord,   You are highly exalted
C#m              B       F#m       A
    And there is nothing You can't do
A  B        C#m7        B
O  Lord, my eyes are on You
   A  B  C#m     A       B    E
Be magni-fied, O Lord be magnified

       C#m           B         F#m    A     B    C#m
I have leaned on the wisdom of men, O Lord,   forgive me
    C#m      B          F#m     A             B              C#m
And I have responded to them  instead of Your light and Your mercy
    E      B       F#m    A      A       B         C#m7          B
But now, O Lord, I see my wrong  heal my heart and show Yourself strong
E         B        F#m   A       A        B    C#m     A        B    E
And in my eyes and in my song  O Lord, be magnified, O Lord, be magnified
