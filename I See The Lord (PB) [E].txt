E5           F#m7/E         A/E    E      Bsus
   I see the Lord and He is seated on the throne
                 A2/F#  A2                E5
The train of His robe      is filling the heavens
          F#m7/E         A/E     E        Bsus
I see the Lord and He is shining like the sun
                 A2/F#  E2/G#                    D2     A
His eyes full of fire,        His voice like the waters
E2/G#    A2/F#                   Bsus
      Surrounding His throne are thousands, singing
