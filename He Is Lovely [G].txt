G                             C
I can see that you love Jesus first, it's plain to see
E                                      G         D
  And that you sit close, and hear His heartbeat
G                      C
For in Your eyes I see shining love, that speaks so clear
D                               G
  And I can hear them saying so sweetly

Gave supremely, that all men might see

Master Maker Life Creator come, and dwell in me
E                                     G     D
  That my heart may know, Your tender mercy
G                                      C
Shine through me that all may see Your love, so full and free
D                                               G
  And I'll declare Your praise, through endless ages
