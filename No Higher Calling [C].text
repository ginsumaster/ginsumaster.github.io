Verse 1:
Down at Your feet oh Lord, is the most high place
In Your presence Lord,
I seek Your face
I seek Your face

Chorus:
There is no higher calling, no great honor
Than to bow and kneel before Your throne
I'm amazed at Your glory, embraced by Your mercy
Oh Lord, I live to worship You

Verse 2:
Down at Your feet oh Lord
..
We seek Your face
