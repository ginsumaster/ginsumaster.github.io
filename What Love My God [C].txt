   ————————— Verse 1: ——————————————————————————————————————————
             C                   F       C
What love my God would bring You down to earth
                F                     C
What king would take a low and lonely birth
            F                         Am7
Yet to this dark and broken place You came
           C         G                  C
To sleep beneath the stars that You had made

What love my God would send the Way of Life
            F                    C
To walk the road, rejected and despised
               F                      Am7
That You might know the weakness I possess
          C       G                     C    Csus  C
And be my rock of strength and righteousness

   ————————— Chorus: ———————————————————————————————————————————
       F                  C
O Your love my God like a flood
          G                  Am7
As heaven opened up  pouring out on us
             F                    C
O praise the King who came to the world
T:        G                  C     T: Am7
   In His love like a mighty flood

What love my God could hold You to the tree
             F                     C
To bear that overwhelming debt for me
           F                          Am7
The Son of heaven leaves the Father's side
           C           G                C   Csus  C
The Healer bleeds, the Life was made to die

What love my God, so gracious and extreme
            F                           C
Was strong enough to come and fight for me
              F                      Am7
To go through hell and down into the grave
             C     G               C
And raise me up to see You face to face
             C     G               C    Csus  C
You raise me up to see You face to face
