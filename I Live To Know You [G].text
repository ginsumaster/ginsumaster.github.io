Standing in Your presence
Lord my heart and life are changed
Just to love You and to live to
See Your beauty and Your grace

Heaven and earth cry out Your name
Nations rise up and see Your face
And Your kingdom is established
As I live to know You more
Now I will never be the same
Spirit of God, my life You've changed
And I'll forever sing Your praise
I live to know You more
I live to know You more

You've called me - I will follow
Your will for me I'm sure
Let Your heartbeat be my heart's cry
Let me live to serve Your call
