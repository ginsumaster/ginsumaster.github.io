<p>Great is the Lord and most worthy of praise</p><br>
<p>In the city of our God- the Holy Place</p><br>
<p>The joy of the whole earth</p><br>
<p>Great is the Lord in whom we have the victory</p><br>
<p>He aids us against the enemy</p><br>
<p>We bow down on our knees</p><br>
<br>

<p>And Lord we want to lift Your name on high</p><br>
<p>And Lord we want to thank You</p><br>

<p>And Lord we trust in Your unfailing love</p><br>
<p>For You alone are God eternal</p><br>
<p>You on earth and in heaven above!</p><br>
