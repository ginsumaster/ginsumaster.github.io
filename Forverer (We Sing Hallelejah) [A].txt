   ————————— Verse 1: ——————————————————————————————————————————
A                         E/G#                     F#m
  The moon and stars they wept the morning sun was dead
                  DM7
The Savior of the world was fallen
A                 E/G#                           F#m
  His body on the cross His blood poured out for us
                    DM7        A
The weight of every curse upon Him

   ————————— Verse 2: ——————————————————————————————————————————
A                     E/G#                   F#m
  One final breath He gave as heaven looked away
                   DM7
The Son of God was laid in darkness
A                 E/G#                       F#m
  A battle in the grave the war on death was waged
                     DM7
The power of hell forever broken

   ————————— Pre-Chorus: ———————————————————————————————————————
A                     E                           F#m
  The ground began to shake the stone was rolled away
His (perfect) (reckless) love could not be overcome
A/C#                         E                     F#m
     Now death where is your sting our resurrected King
                   D
Has rendered you defeated
   ————————— Chorus: ———————————————————————————————————————————
       A          E                         D
Now forever He is glorified   forever He is lifted high
       A          E                              D
And forever He is risen   He is alive and He is alive

   ————————— Bridge: ———————————————————————————————————————————
A              E                  F#m
  We sing hallelujah we sing hallelujah
             D
We sing hallelujah the Lamb has overcome
(REPEAT)
A              E                                     D
  We sing hallelujah we sing hallelujah we sing hallelujah

   ————————— Ending: ———————————————————————————————————————————

  And now death where is your sting our resurrected King has overcome
