   ————————— Verse 1: ——————————————————————————————————————————
    G                        Em7
The nails in Your hands, the nails in Your feet
C2                        Dsus    D
They tell me how much You love me
    G                    Em7
The thorns in Your brow, they tell me how
    C2                   Dsus    B
You bore so much pain to love me

   ————————— Pre-Chorus: ———————————————————————————————————————
               Bm            Em
Until when the heavens pass away
         Bm                 Em
All Your scars will still remain
       Bm             Em
And forever they will say
     C            D
Just how much You love me
     C/D     D
So I want to say

   ————————— Chorus: ———————————————————————————————————————————
   G
Forever my love
   Em7
Forever my heart
   C2              D
Forever my life is Yours
   ————————— Ending: ———————————————————————————————————————————
     G
It's Yours
