<p>Love divine all loves excelling, Joy of heaven to earth come down</p><br>
<p>Fix in us Thy humble dwelling, all Thy faithful mercies crown</p><br>
<p>Jesus Thou art all compassion, pure unbounded love Thou art</p><br>
<p>Visit us with Thy salvation, enter every trembling heart</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Verse 2: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”</big></sup></h3>
<p>Breathe, O breathe Thy loving Spirit, into every troubled breast</p><br>
<p>Let us all in Thee inherit, let us find the promised rest</p><br>
<p>Take away our bent to sinning, Alpha and Omega be</p><br>
<p>End of faith as its beginning, set our hearts at liberty</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Verse 3: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”</big></sup></h3>
<p>Come Almighty to deliver, let us all Thy life receive</p><br>
<p>Suddenly return and never, never more Thy temples leave</p><br>
<p>Thee we would be always blessing, serve Thee as Thy hosts above</p><br>
<p>Pray and praise Thee without ceasing, glory in Thy perfect love</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Verse 4: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”</big></sup></h3>
<p>Finish then Thy new creation, pure and spotless let us be</p><br>
<p>Let us see Thy great salvation, perfectly restored in Thee</p><br>
<p>Changed from glory into glory, till in heav'n we take our place</p><br>
<p>Till we cast our crowns before Thee, lost in wonder, love, and praise</p><br>
