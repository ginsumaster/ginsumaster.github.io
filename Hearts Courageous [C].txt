   ————————— Verse 1: ——————————————————————————————————————————
        C                 G            Am
Give us ears to hear that still, small voice
            C            F            G
And give us lips forever willing to rejoice
            F                C
And may our eyes be lit with wisdom
       G                    Am
May we know the path that's true
          F                     G            C
And we'll march with hearts courageous after You

   ————————— Chorus: ———————————————————————————————————————————
               F  G  C                G  C
We're marching on,     with hearts coura-geous
             F  G  C                 C
We'll follow a- ny-where You want us to
               F    G  C                Am
And should You lead us where the battle rages
       F                    G             C
Let us march with hearts courageous after You

   ————————— Verse 2: ——————————————————————————————————————————
         C               G               Am
And when sorrow dims the light along the way
           C                F                        G
Help us to see each time of darkness through eyes of faith
           F                C
A time for hope, a time for courage
        G                Am
Knowing You will lead us through
          F                     G            C
And we'll march with hearts courageous after You
