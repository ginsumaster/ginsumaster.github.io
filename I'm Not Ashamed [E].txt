Jesus   You're my Lord my everything
  C#m7  A  E/G#      F#m7               B
Jesus      it's Your blood that made me clean

Hallelujah hallelujah

   ————————— Verse 1: ——————————————————————————————————————————
E        A              B          A
I'm not ashamed of Your love; not ashamed of Your grace
E        A             B           A
I'm not ashamed of the cross; not ashamed of Your Word
E        A                B          A
From the highest mountain top to the lowest valley low
E               A              B           A
I'll shout Your name until the whole world knows

   ————————— Verse 2: ——————————————————————————————————————————
E          A                B                A
What can I do but dance and shout? I have to let these praises out
E          A             B             A
I once was lost and O so bound by Your grace I have been found
E          A                    B                 A
And if the world can scream and shout for earthly temporary things
E     A               B         A
I can give my loudest praise to Thee
