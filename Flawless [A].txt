   ————————— Verse 1: ——————————————————————————————————————————
                  G
There's got to be more than going back and forth
           D
From doing right to doing wrong, 'cause we were taught that's who we are
             C                            G
Well come on get in line right behind me, You along with ev'rybody
Thinking there's worth in what you do

   ————————— Pre-Chorus: ———————————————————————————————————————
G
  Then like a hero who takes the stage when
D                                                C
  We're on the edge of our seats saying it's too late
                              G
Well let me introduce you to amazing grace

   ————————— Chorus: ———————————————————————————————————————————
   G
No matter the bumps, no matter the bruises
   D
No matter the scars, still the truth is
    C                                       G
The cross has made,  the cross has made you flawless

   G
No matter the hurt or how deep the wound is
   D
No matter the pain, still the truth is
    C                                       G
The cross has made,  the cross has made you flawless

   ————————— Verse 2: ——————————————————————————————————————————
                  G
Could it possibly be  that we simply can't believe
           D
That this  unconditional kind of love would be enough to
C
  Take a filthy wretch like this and wrap him up in righteousness
G
  But that's exactly what He did

   ————————— Bridge 1: —————————————————————————————————————————
D       C
Oooooo, Oooooo
G
  Take a breath smile and say right here right now I'm okay
  D          C          G
Because  the cross was enough

   ————————— Bridge 2: —————————————————————————————————————————
G                                               D
  No matter what they say or what you think you are
The day you called His name
            C                     G
He made you flawless, He made you flawless
