G
No not by might, nor even pow'r
                     C
But by Your Spirit O Lord
C                 G
Healer of hearts, binder of wounds
C              D      G
Lives that are lost restored
T: C
   Flow through this land
G              C            D         G
'Til every man praises Your name once more
