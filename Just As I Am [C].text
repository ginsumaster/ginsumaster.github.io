To rid my soul of one dark blot
To Thee whose blood can cleanse each spot
O Lamb of God I come. I come

The breadth, length, depth, and height to prove
Here for a season, then above
O Lamb of God I come. I come

Just as I am though tossed about
With many a con-flict many a doubt
Fightings and fears within without
O Lamb of God I come. I come

7: Just as I am poor wretched blind
Sight riches heal-ing of the mind
Yea all I need in Thee to find
O Lamb of God I come. I come
