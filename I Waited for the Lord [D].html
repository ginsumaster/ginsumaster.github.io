<h3><sup><big>    â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Chorus: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”</big></sup></h3>
<p>I waited,  for the Lord on high</p><br>

<p>He pulled me out  of my despair,</p><br>

<p>From quicksand  to a rock</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Verse 2: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”</big></sup></h3>
<p>I'll sing to let  the people know,</p><br>
<p>That I have been  restored</p><br>
<p>They will kneel  and understand,</p><br>
<p>To return and trust  in the Lord</p><br>
<br>

<p>There's a new song,  in my heart to sing</p><br>
<p>        A new song,     praises for my King (X2)</p><br>
