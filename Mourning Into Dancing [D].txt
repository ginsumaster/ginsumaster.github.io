            G        C    G
Where there once was only hurt

Piercing my darkness

I see the bright and morning sun

As it ushers in His joy- ful  glad-ness

    His anger lasts for a moment in time
        G/A      A7
But His favor is here
         A9(b5)       C/D  G/D  C/D  D
And will be on me for all  my   life-time
