Your love    is extravagant.
Your friendship    Mmm intimate
I find I'm moving to the rhythm of Your grace
Your fragrance is intoxicating in our secret place
Your love    is extravagant.

Spread wide in the arms of Christ
Is the love that covers sin
No greater love have I ever known
You consider me a friend
Capture my heart again
