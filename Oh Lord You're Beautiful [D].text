Oh Lord, You're beautiful
Your face is all I seek
For when Your eyes are on this child
Your grace(*love*) abounds  to me

I want to take Your Word and shine it all around
First help me just to live it Lord
And when I'm doing well, help me to never seek a crown
For my reward is giving glory to You

â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Verse 2: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”
Oh Lord, please light the fire
That once burned bright and clear
Replace the lamp of my first love
That burns with holy  fear

Oh Lord, my body's tired.
But You keep reminding me
Of many, holy tireless  men
Who spilt their blood  for Thee

And if I'm doing good, help me to never make a sound
Except to give all glory to You

Oh Lord, my faith is small
And I need a touch from You
Your book of books lies undisturbed
And the prayers from me to You to few
