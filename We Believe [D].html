<h3><sup><big>    â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Verse 1: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”</big></sup></h3>
<p> In this time of desperation  when all we know is doubt and fear</p><br>
<p> There is only one foundation we believe we believe</p><br>
<p> In this broken generation  when all is dark You help us see</p><br>
<p> There is only one salvation we believe we believe</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Chorus: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”</big></sup></h3>
<p>We believe in God the Father we believe in Jesus Christ</p><br>
<p>We believe in the Holy Spirit and He's given us new life</p><br>
<p>We believe in the crucifixion we believe that He conquered death</p><br>
<p>We believe in the resurrection and He's coming back again</p><br>
<p>(We believe)</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Verse 2: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”</big></sup></h3>
<p> So let our faith be more than anthems  greater than the songs we sing</p><br>
<p> In our weakness and temptations we believe we believe</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Bridge: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”</big></sup></h3>
<p>Let the lost be found and the dead be raised</p><br>
<p>In the here and now let love invade</p><br>
<p>Let the church live loud our God will save</p><br>
<p>We believe we believe</p><br>
<p>And the gates of hell will not prevail</p><br>
<p>For the pow'r of God has torn the veil</p><br>
<p>Now we know Your love will never fail</p><br>
<p>We believe we believe</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Ending: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”</big></sup></h3>
<p>He's coming back again</p><br>
<p>He's coming back again we believe we believe</p><br>
