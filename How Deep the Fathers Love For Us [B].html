<h3><sup><big>    â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Verse 1: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”</big></sup></h3>
<p>How deep the Father's love for us    how vast beyond all measure</p><br>
<p>That He should give His only Son  to make a wretch His treasure</p><br>
<p>How great the pain of searing loss   the Father turns His face away</p><br>
<p>As wounds which mar the Chosen One  bring many sons to glory</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Verse 2: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”</big></sup></h3>
<p>Behold the Man upon a cross  my sin upon His shoulders</p><br>
<p>Ashamed I hear my mocking voice  call out among the scoffers</p><br>
<p>It was my sin that held Him there  until it was accomplished</p><br>
<p>His dying breath has brought me life  I know that it is finished</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Verse 3: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”</big></sup></h3>
<p>I will not boast in anything  no gifts no pow'r no wisdom</p><br>
<p>But I will boast in Jesus Christ  His death and resurrection</p><br>
<p>Why should I gain from His reward  I cannot give an answer</p><br>
<p>But this I know with all my heart  His wounds have paid my ransom</p><br>
