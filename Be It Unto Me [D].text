Be it unto me, according to Your word
According to Your promises, I can stand secure
Carve upon my heart, the truth that sets me free
According to Your Word O Lord, be it unto me

You promised Your blood will deliver
And Lord we believe it's true
You promised us joy like a riv-er
And Lord we receive it from You
These things You have spoken, and You're bringing to pass
This world's disappearing, but Your Word will last

He promised to carry our sorrows
Lord we believe it's true
You promised unending tomor-rows
Lord, we receive them from You
You'll be our provider, in Your Word it's revealed
And by the stripes You bore Lord, we have been healed
