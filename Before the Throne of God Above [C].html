<h3><sup><big>    â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Verse 1: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”</big></sup></h3>
<p>Before the throne of God above, I have a strong, a perfect plea</p><br>
<p>A great High Priest whose name is Love, Who ever lives and pleads for me</p><br>
<p>My name is graven on His hands; my name is written on His heart</p><br>
<p>I know that while in heaven He stands, no tongue can bid me thence depart</p><br>
<p>No tongue can bid me thence depart</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Verse 2: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”</big></sup></h3>
<p>When Satan tempts me to despair, and tells me of the guilt within</p><br>
<p>Upward I look and see Him there, Who made an end to all my sin</p><br>
<p>Because the sinless Saviour died, my sinful soul is counted free</p><br>
<p>For God the Just is satisfied, to look on Him and pardon me</p><br>
<p>To look on Him and pardon me</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Verse 3: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”</big></sup></h3>
<p>Behold Him there! The risen Lamb, my perfect, spotless Righteousness</p><br>
<p>The great unchangeable I Am, the King of glory and of grace!</p><br>
<p>One with Himself I cannot die; my soul is purchased with His blood</p><br>
<p>My life is hid with Christ on high, with Christ my Saviour and my God</p><br>
<p>With Christ my Saviour and my God</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Verse 4: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”</big></sup></h3>
<p>I bow before the cross of Christ, and marvel at this love divine</p><br>
<p>God's perfect Son was sacrificed, to make me righteous in God's eyes</p><br>
<p>This river's depths I cannot know, but I can glory in its flood</p><br>
<p>The Lord Most High has bowed down low, and poured on me His glorious love</p><br>
<p>And poured on me His glorious love</p><br>
