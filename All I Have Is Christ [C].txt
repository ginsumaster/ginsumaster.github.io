   ————————— Verse 1: ——————————————————————————————————————————
           G               Am                   F        Am
I once was lost in darkest night  yet thought I knew the way
             Dm               F                G      C
The sin that promised joy and life  had led me to the grave
         C                   F            F       Am
I had no hope that You would own  a rebel to Your will
           C                F                F        G
And if You had not loved me first  I would refuse You still

   ————————— Verse 2: ——————————————————————————————————————————
         G                 Am                F      Am
But as I ran my hell-bound race  indifferent to the cost
            Dm              F                 G      C
You looked upon my helpless state  and led me to the cross
        C                  F                    F     Am
And I beheld God's love displayed  You suffered in my place
             C                  F             F       G
You bore the wrath reserved for me  now all I know is grace

   ————————— Chorus: ———————————————————————————————————————————
     F  C          G       Am
Hallelu-jah! All I have is Christ
     F  Am         G     C
Hallelu-jah! Jesus is my life

   ————————— Verse 3: ——————————————————————————————————————————
             G               Am                F         Am
Now, Lord, I would be Yours alone  and live so all might see
                Dm             F                  G         C
The strength to follow Your commands  could never come from me
          C               F            F       Am
O Father, use my ransomed life  in any way You choose
           C            F           F        G
And let my song forever be  my only boast is You
