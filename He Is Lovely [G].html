<h3><sup><big>    ————————— Verse 1: ———————————————————————————————————————————————————</big></sup></h3>
<p>I can see that you love Jesus first, it's plain to see</p><br>
<p> And that you sit close, and hear His heartbeat</p><br>
<p>For in Your eyes I see shining love, that speaks so clear</p><br>
<p> And I can hear them saying so sweetly</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    ————————— Chorus 1: ——————————————————————————————————————————————————</big></sup></h3>
<p>He is lovely, He is holy</p><br>
<p>Gave supremely, that all men might see</p><br>
<p>He is gentle, tenderhearted</p><br>
<p>Risen Saviour, He is God</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    ————————— Verse 2: ———————————————————————————————————————————————————</big></sup></h3>
<p>Master Maker Life Creator come, and dwell in me</p><br>

<p>Shine through me that all may see Your love, so full and free</p><br>
<p> And I'll declare Your praise, through endless ages</p><br>
<br>
