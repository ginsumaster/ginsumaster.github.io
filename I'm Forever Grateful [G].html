<p>You did not wait for me to draw near to You</p><br>
<p>But You clothed Yourself with frail humanity</p><br>
<p>You did not wait for me to cry out to You</p><br>
<p>But You let me hear Your voice calling me</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Chorus: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”</big></sup></h3>
<p>And I'm forever grateful to You</p><br>
<p>And I'm forever grateful for the cross</p><br>
<p>And I'm forever grateful  to You</p><br>
<p>That You came  to seek and save the lost</p><br>
