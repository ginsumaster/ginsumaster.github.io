 <p>When the Father  made us</p><br>
<h6>             Bm</h6><br>
 <p>He knew we'd run from Him  and try to hide our sin</p><br>
<h6>       D</h6><br>
 <p>But He wanted  to save us</p><br>

<br>
<h3><sup><big>    ————————— Chorus: —————————————————————————————————————————————————</big></sup></h3>

<h6>         D</h6><br>
 <p>When the Spirit  calls us</p><br>
<h6>              Bm</h6><br>
