<h3><sup><big>    â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Verse 1: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”</big></sup></h3>
<p>Why should I feel discouraged, why should the shadows come</p><br>
<p>Why should my heart be lonely, and long for heav'n and home</p><br>
<p>When Jesus is my portion, my constant Friend is He</p><br>
<p>His eye is on the sparrow, and I know He watches me</p><br>
<p>His eye is on the sparrow, and I know He watches me</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Chorus: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”</big></sup></h3>
<p>I sing because I'm happy, I sing because I'm free</p><br>
<p>For His eye is on the sparrow, and I know He watches me</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Verse 2: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”</big></sup></h3>
<p>"Let not your heart be troubled," His tender word I hear</p><br>
<p>And resting on His goodness, I lose my doubt and fear</p><br>
<p>Tho' by the path He leadeth, but one step I may see</p><br>
<p>His eye is on the sparrow, and I know He watches me</p><br>
<p>His eye is on the sparrow, and I know He watches me</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Verse 3: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”</big></sup></h3>
<p>Whenever I am tempted, whenever clouds arise</p><br>
<p>When song gives place to sighing, when hope within me dies</p><br>
<p>I draw the closer to Him; from care He sets me free</p><br>
<p>His eye is on the sparrow, and I know He cares for me</p><br>
<p>His eye is on the sparrow, and I know He cares for me</p><br>
