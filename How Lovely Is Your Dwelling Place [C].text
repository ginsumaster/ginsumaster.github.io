How lovely is Your dwelling place,  Almighty Lord
There's a hunger, deep inside my soul
Only in Your presence, are my heart and flesh restored
How lovely is Your dwelling place

â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Verse 1: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”
In Your courts there's shelter, for the greatest and the small
The sparrow has a place to build her nest
The pilgrim finds refreshment, in the rains that fall
And each one has the strength, to meet the test

â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Verse 2: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”
A single day is better, when spent in humble praise
Than a thousand days, of living without You
The Lord bestows His favor, on each one who obeys
And blessings on the man, whose heart is true
