   E                                          A
In just one word,  You calm the storm that surrounds me
     E                                     A
Yeah just one word,  the darkness has to retreat
   E                                       A
In just one touch,  I feel the presence of heaven
     E                                          A
Yeah just one touch,  my eyes were opened to see   My heart can't help but believe

There's nothing that our God  can't  do  There's not a mountain that He  can't  move
                  C#m                  B                           A

Yeah just one word,  You heal what's broken inside me
   E                                   A
Oh just one word  and you revive every dream
     E                                    A
Yeah just one touch,  I feel the power of heaven

Just one touch,   my eyes were opened to see   My heart can't help but believe
