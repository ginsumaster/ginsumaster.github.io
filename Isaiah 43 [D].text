Yahweh, You have created me
You have called me by name, and I am Yours
Forever, I will sing of Your goodness
I will walk now in freedom to the kingdom of glory

â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Verse 1: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”
When I walk through the sea
My God will walk with me
And the rivers will not swallow me

â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Verse 2: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”
Though I walk through the fire
I will not be scorched nor burned
And the flames will not harm me at all

â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Verse 3: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”
You call us Your people
We are precious in the eyes of God
And You give nations in return for our lives

â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Verse 4: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”
We are servants of the Lord
And we shall not be afraid
For God is with us, and He has made us for His glory

â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Ending: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”
To the kingdom of glory
