I'm the one who held the nail  It was cold between my fingertips
     G#m           E  B           G#m                   E
I've hidden in the garden  I've denied You with my very lips

I've done things I wish I hadn't done  I've seen things I wish I hadn't seen
F#sus  G#m              E      B          B/A#  G#m            E

G#m7                                   E2
     I could have been six feet under,    I could have been lost forever
B                                B2/D#
  Yeah, I should be in that fire       and now there's a fire inside of me
G#m7                                E2
     Here I am, a dead man walking,    no grave gonna hold God's people
B                                B2/D#
  All the weight of all our evil       lifted away, forever free
E2
   Who could believe, who could believe

   ————————— Chorus 2: —————————————————————————————————————————
   B         F#sus/A#   G#m7                        E2
Forgiven, forgiven  You love me even when I don't deserve it
   B         F#sus/A#  G#m7        B              E2
Forgiven, forgiven     Jesus, Your blood makes me innocent
          G#m7            F#sus
So I will say goodbye  to ev'ry sin
        G#m  E  B          G#m  E  B
I am forgiven,     I am forgiven
