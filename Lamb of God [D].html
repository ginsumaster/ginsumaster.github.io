<p>Your only Son, no sin to hide</p><br>
<p>But You have sent,  Him from Your side</p><br>
<p>To walk upon,  this guilty sod</p><br>
<p>And to become the Lamb of God</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Chorus: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”</big></sup></h3>
<p> Oh Lamb of God,  sweet Lamb of God</p><br>
<p>I love the holy Lamb of God</p><br>
<p>Oh wash me in,  Your precious blood</p><br>
<p>My Jesus Christ the Lamb of God</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Verse 2: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”</big></sup></h3>
<p>Your gift of love, they crucified</p><br>

<p>The humble King,  they named a fraud</p><br>
<p>And sacrificed the Lamb of God</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Verse 3: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”</big></sup></h3>
<p>I was so lost, I should have died</p><br>
<p>But You have brought,  me to Your side</p><br>
<p>To be led by  Your staff and rod</p><br>
<p>And to be called a lamb of God</p><br>
