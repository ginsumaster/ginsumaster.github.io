   ————————— Verse 1: ——————————————————————————————————————————
Am                  G                      F
   Before I spoke a word, You were singing over me
Am               G               F
   You have been so, so good  to me
Am                 G                          F
   Before I took a breath,  You breathed Your life in me
Am               G               F
   You have been so, so kind  to me

   ————————— Chorus: ———————————————————————————————————————————
       Am            G             F                 C
O, the overwhelming, never-ending, reckless love  of God
      Am              G                      F                  C
O, it chases me down, fights 'til I'm found, leaves  the ninety-nine
           Am                 G                   F              C
I couldn't earn it, I don't deserve it, still You give Yourself away
       Am            G             F                 C
O, the overwhelming, never-ending, reckless love  of God, yeah

   ————————— Verse 2: ——————————————————————————————————————————
Am                 G                     F
   When I was Your foe,  still Your love fought  for me
Am               G               F
   You have been so, so good  to me
Am                G                            F
   When I felt no worth,  You paid it all  for me
Am               G               F
   You have been so, so kind  to me

   ————————— Bridge 1: —————————————————————————————————————————
Am
   There's no shadow You won't light up  Mountain You won't climb up  coming after me
There's no wall You won't kick down  Lie You won't tear down  coming after me

   ————————— Bridge 2: —————————————————————————————————————————
Am                             G
   There's no shadow You won't light up
                   F                      C
Mountain You won't climb up  coming after me
Am                           G
   There's no wall You won't kick down
              F                       C
Lie You won't tear down  coming after me
