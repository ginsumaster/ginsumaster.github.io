   ————————— Verse 1: ——————————————————————————————————————————
G                                          Bm
You spread out the skies over empty space, said, "Let there be light"
                                              G     A
Into a dark and formless world Your light was born.
G                                           Bm
You spread out your arms over empty hearts, said, "Let there be light"
                                            G     A
Into a dark and hopeless world Your Son was born.

   ————————— Pre-Chorus: ———————————————————————————————————————
    Em                 F#m             G
You made the world and saw that it was good.
    Em             F#m             G     A
You sent your only Son for You are good.

What a wonderful Maker.  What a wonderful Savior.
                  G         A                 D
How majestic Your whispers.   How humble Your love.
                        G                         Bm
With a strength like no other, and the heart of a father.
                  G         A                  D    E:G
How majestic Your whispers.   What a wonderful God.

   G                                                Bm
No eye has fully seen, how beautiful the cross, and we have only heard
                                       G
The faintest whispers of how great You are.
   G                                                Bm
No eye has fully seen, how beautiful the cross, and we have only heard
                                       G    A
The faintest whispers of how great You are.
