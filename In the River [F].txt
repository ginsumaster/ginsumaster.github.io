           F               Dm
There is a river     where goodness flows
           Am             Em
There is a fountain  that drowns sorrows
            F        Dm
There is an ocean    deeper than fear
            Am             Em
The tide is rising, rising

There is a current   stirring deep inside

It's overflowing     from the heart of God
             F                Dm
The flood of heaven  crashing over us
            Am             Em
The tide is rising, rising

F         Dm        Am                  Em
Bursting, bursting  up from the ground  we feel it now

Bursting, bursting  up from the ground  we feel it now

We come alive in the river     We come alive in the river
         F                 Dm           Am                Em
We come alive in the river     We come alive in the river

           F            Dm              Am            Em
Break open prison doors     set all the captives free
            F                  Dm                  Am         Em
Spring up a well,  spring up a well  spring up the well in me
            F             Dm                Am             Em
Nothing can stop this joy     we're dancing in the streets
T:             F                  Dm                  Am         Em
   Spring up a well,  spring up a well  spring up the well in me
