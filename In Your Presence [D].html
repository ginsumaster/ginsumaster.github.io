<p>I was lost, but now I'm found.</p><br>
<p>I'm finally standing on solid ground</p><br>
<p>I was lifted from sinking sand.</p><br>
<p>Jesus took my hand and said follow Me.</p><br>
<p>He saved my soul and He set me free.</p><br>
<p>I was rescued from the lion's den</p><br>
<p>That was the day my life began again.</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Chorus: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”</big></sup></h3>
<p>I am not gonna waste another day</p><br>
<p>Reaching for the world's empty glass again</p><br>
<p>Jesus pour Your Holy Spirit over me now</p><br>
<p>Oh Lord fill me  with Your essence</p><br>
<p>Overflow me  with Your blessings</p><br>
<p>For I long to be..  in Your presence</p><br>
<br>

<p>I was blind, but now I see.. a new heart beats inside of me</p><br>
<p>I was promised love eternally</p><br>
<p>There's only one road I believe</p><br>
<p>It's found through the man who died for me</p><br>
<p>He paid the price for every sin</p><br>
<p>Believe in Him and you too will win</p><br>
<br>
