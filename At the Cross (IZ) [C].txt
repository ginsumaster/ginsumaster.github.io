Would He devote that sacred head for sinners such as I!

       C                            G
At the cross, at the cross, where I first saw the light
        F                          C
And the burden of my heart rolled away
       F                  C         Am
It was there by faith I received my sight
    Dm       G             C   F  C
And now I am happy all the day

Was it for crimes that I have done He groaned up-on the tree?

Amazing pity grace unknown and love beyond degree!

Well might the sun in darkness hide and shut His glories in,
     C                                Dm      G6         C
When Christ the mighty Maker died for man the creature's sin

     C                                   F  C      F     C  G
Thus might I hide my blushing face while Calvary's cross ap-pears
   C                                  Dm        G6      C
Dissolve my heart in thankfulness and melt mine eyes to tears

But drops of grief can ne'er repay the debt of love I  owe:
      C                             Dm       G6    C
Here, Lord, I give myself away 'tis all that I can do!
