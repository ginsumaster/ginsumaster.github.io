My hope is built on nothing less
Than Jesus' blood and righteousness
I dare not trust the sweetest frame
But wholly trust in Je-  sus' Name
(REPEAT)

Christ alone Cornerstone
Weak made strong in the Saviour's love
Through the storm He is Lord Lord of all

When darkness seems to hide His face
I rest on His unchanging grace
In every high and stormy gale
My anchor holds within  the veil
My anchor holds within  the veil

When He shall come with trumpet sound
Oh may I then in Him be found
Dressed in His righteousness alone
Faultless stand before  the throne
