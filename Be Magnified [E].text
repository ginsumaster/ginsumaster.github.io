â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Verse 1: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”
I have made You too small in my eyes, O Lord forgive me
And I have believed in a lie  that You were unable to help me
But now, O Lord, I see my wrong  heal my heart and show Yourself strong
And in my eyes and in my song  O Lord, be magnified, O Lord, be magnified

â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Chorus: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”
Be magnified, O Lord,  You are highly exalted
And there is nothing You can't do
O Lord, my eyes are on You
Be magnified, O Lord be magnified

â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Verse 2: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”
I have leaned on the wisdom of men, O Lord,  forgive me
And I have responded to them  instead of Your light and Your mercy
But now, O Lord, I see my wrong  heal my heart and show Yourself strong
And in my eyes and in my song  O Lord, be magnified, O Lord, be magnified
