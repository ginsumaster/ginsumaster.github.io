   ————————— Verse 1: ——————————————————————————————————————————
         G                                 C
Come and stand before your Maker   full of wonder, full of fear;
       G                                    C
Come behold his power and glory    yet with confidence draw near,
        Em                                D
For the One who holds the heavens  and commands the stars above
       C                                   D
Is the God who bends to bless us   with an unrelenting love.

  G                Em                  C            G
Rejoice!  Come and lift your hands and raise  your  voice;
      Em            C
He is worthy of all praise
  G                C                              Em    D       G
Rejoice!  Sing the mercies of your King  and with trembling,  rejoice.

       G                               C
We are children of the promise,  the beloved of the Lord.
         G                                   C
Won with everlasting kindness,   bought with sacrificial blood.
         Em                           D
Bringing reconciliation          to a world that longs to know
      C                                   D
The affections of a Father       Who will never let them go.

   ————————— Verse 3: ——————————————————————————————————————————
        G                                 C
All our sickness, all our sorrows   Jesus carried up the hill.
       G                                  C
He has walked this path before us,  He is walking with us still;
        Em                                  D
Turning tragedy to triumph,         turning agony to praise,
         C                                  D
There is blessing in the battle     so take heart and stand amazed.

  G/B              C             G/B          C
Rejoice!  When you cry to Him He hears  your  voice;
        Em             C
He will wipe away your tears
  G              C                           Em        Dsus     G
Rejoice!  In the midst of suffering  He will help  you sing,  rejoice.
