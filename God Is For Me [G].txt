G                     D                Em  C
  Looking out, it's a great big world,
G              D            Em  C
Where do I go? How do I fit in?
G                 D               Em    C
  Gotta keep this one thing on my mind,
G                D           Em    C
Maker of all the universe is on my side.

(And) if God is for me, who can be, who can be against me?
         G      D       Em          C
(And) if God is for me, who can be, who can be against me?
G          D                  Em        C
  He is my strength, he is my friend forever.
         G      D       Em          C
(And) if God is for me, who can be, who can be against me?

  When I just don't understand, God is for me
     G                   D              Em     C
When life doesn't go the way I planned. God is for me.
