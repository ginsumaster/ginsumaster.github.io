   ————————— Verse 1: ——————————————————————————————————————————
G        Am6  D               G/B        Am/C     G
I can do all  things, through Christ who gives me strength
        C       G/B         Am     D/F#       G
But sometimes I wonder what He can do through me
   G        Am6     D     /C    G/B   Am/C  Em7
No great success to show,    no glory on my own
          C        G/B   Am              Am  D
Yet in my weakness He is there to let me know

   ————————— Chorus: ———————————————————————————————————————————
G   Am       G/B  CM7           D/F#            G    (C/G  G
His strength is   perfect, when our strength is gone ]
G             CM7        D/F#        Dm
  He'll carry us when we can't carry on
E7               AmaddB    D/F#  BaddC/D#  Em  /D
   Raised in His power the weak  become    strong
A/C#                 AmaddB
     His strength is perfect
D/F#                 Am/G    G
     His strength is perfect

   ————————— Verse 2: ——————————————————————————————————————————
G      Am6  D         G/B   Am/C    G
We can only know, the power that He holds
        C     G/B     Am       D/F#     G
When we truly see how deep our weakness goes
    G           Am6  D     /C      G/B        Am/C  Em7
His strength in us begins,    when ours comes to an end
   C         G/B    Am               Am  D
He hears our humble cry, and proves again
