I love You Lord,  oh Your mercy never fails me
All my days  I've been held in Your hands
From the moment that I wake up,  until I lay my head
Oh, I will sing  of the goodness  of God

'Cause all my life You have been faithful
And all my life You have been so, so good
With every breath that I am able
Oh, I will sing of the goodness of God

I love Your voice, You have led me through the fire
In darkest nights  You are close like no other
I've known You as a father,  I've known You as a friend
And I have lived in the goodness of God

'Cause Your goodness is running after,  it's running after me
Your goodness is running after,  it's running after me
With my life laid down, I'm surrendered now, I give You everything
Your goodness is running after,  it's running after me
