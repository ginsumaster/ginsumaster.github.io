<h3><sup><big>    ————————— Verse 1: ———————————————————————————————————————————————————</big></sup></h3>
<p>There's got to be more than going back and forth</p><br>
<p>From doing right to doing wrong, 'cause we were taught that's who we are</p><br>
<p>Well come on get in line right behind me, You along with ev'rybody</p><br>
<p>Thinking there's worth in what you do</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    ————————— Pre-Chorus: ————————————————————————————————————————————————</big></sup></h3>
<p> Then like a hero who takes the stage when</p><br>
<p> We're on the edge of our seats saying it's too late</p><br>
<p>Well let me introduce you to amazing grace</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    ————————— Chorus: ————————————————————————————————————————————————————</big></sup></h3>
<p>No matter the bumps, no matter the bruises</p><br>
<p>No matter the scars, still the truth is</p><br>
<p>The cross has made,  the cross has made you flawless</p><br>
<br>
<p>No matter the hurt or how deep the wound is</p><br>
<p>No matter the pain, still the truth is</p><br>
<p>The cross has made,  the cross has made you flawless</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    ————————— Verse 2: ———————————————————————————————————————————————————</big></sup></h3>
<p>Could it possibly be  that we simply can't believe</p><br>
<p>That this  unconditional kind of love would be enough to</p><br>
<p> Take a filthy wretch like this and wrap him up in righteousness</p><br>
<p> But that's exactly what He did</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    ————————— Bridge 1: ——————————————————————————————————————————————————</big></sup></h3>
<p>Oooooo, Oooooo</p><br>
<p> Take a breath smile and say right here right now I'm okay</p><br>
<p>Because  the cross was enough</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    ————————— Bridge 2: ——————————————————————————————————————————————————</big></sup></h3>
<p> No matter what they say or what you think you are</p><br>
<p>The day you called His name</p><br>
<p>He made you flawless, He made you flawless</p><br>
