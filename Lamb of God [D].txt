   ————————— Verse 1: ——————————————————————————————————————————
          D
Your only Son, no sin to hide
             Bm    G               A    D
But You have sent,   Him from Your side
         Bm   G             D/F#  G
To walk upon,   this guilty sod
         D        A6      D
And to become the Lamb of God

   ————————— Chorus: ———————————————————————————————————————————
D            Bm   G               D
  Oh Lamb of God,   sweet Lamb of God
           Bm  G          A   D
I love the ho- ly Lamb of God
           Bm  G               Bm    G
Oh wash me in,   Your precious blood
         D          A6      D
My Jesus Christ the Lamb of God

   ————————— Verse 2: ——————————————————————————————————————————
             D
Your gift of love, they crucified
                 Bm       G           A    D
They laughed and scorned,   Him as He died
           Bm    G              D/F#  G
The humble King,   they named a fraud
         D         A6      D
And sacrificed the Lamb of God

   ————————— Verse 3: ——————————————————————————————————————————
         D
I was so lost, I should have died
             Bm       G            A    D
But You have brought,   me to Your side
          Bm  G                D/F#  G
To be led by    Your staff and rod
          D        A6      D
And to be called a lamb of God
