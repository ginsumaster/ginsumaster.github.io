As the deer panteth for the water,
So my soul longeth after Thee
You alone are my heart's desire,
And I long to worship Thee

â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Chorus: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”
You alone are my strength, my shield;
To You alone may my spirit yield
You alone are my heart's desire,
And I long to worship Thee

You're my friend and You are my brother
Even though You are a King
I love You more than any other,
So much more than anything

I want You more than gold or silver,
Only You can satisfy
You alone are the real joy-giver
And the apple of my eye
