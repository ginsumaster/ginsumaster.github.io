<p> I've carried a burden  for too long on my own</p><br>
<p> I wasn't created  to bear it alone</p><br>
<p> I hear Your invitation  to let it all go</p><br>
<p>I see it now  I'm laying it down  I know that I  need  You</p><br>

<p>I run to the Father  I fall into grace  I'm done with the hiding  no reason to wait</p><br>

<p> You saw my condition  had a plan from the start</p><br>
<p> Your Son for redemption  the price for my heart</p><br>

<p>Running into  Your  arms  is running to life  from  death</p><br>
<p>I feel this rush  deep in my chest  Your mercy is calling out</p><br>
<p>Just as I am  You pull me in  I know I need You  now</p><br>
