            D                    F#m7
All who are thirsty  all who are weak

Come to the fountain  dip your heart in the stream  of    life

        G/A          D                  F#m7
Let the pain and the sorrow  be washed away
                    G2    T:               Em7  D/F#  G
In the waves of His mercy   as deep cries  out  to    deep
