He walked where I walk    (echo)
He stood where I stand    (echo)
He felt what I feel       (echo)
He understands            (echo)
He knows my frailty       (echo)
Shared my humanity        (echo)
Tempted in every way      (echo)
Yet without sin

Oneof a hated race        (echo)
Stung by the prejudice    (echo)
Suff'ring injustice       (echo)
Yet He forgives           (echo)
Wept for my wasted years  (echo)
Paid for my wickedness    (echo)
He died in my place       (echo)
That I might live     (echo)
