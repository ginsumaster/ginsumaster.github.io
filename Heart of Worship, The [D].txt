   ————————— Verse 1: ——————————————————————————————————————————
D                A                           G
  When the music fades, and all is stripped away
             Asus  A
And I simply come
D                 A                          G
  Longing just to bring, something that's of worth
                     Asus  A
That will bless Your heart

   ————————— Pre-Chorus: ———————————————————————————————————————
Em                D/F#        A
   I'll bring You more than a song
                Em               D/F#       A
For a song in itself is not what You have required
Em                 D/F#       A
   You search much deeper within
                         Em7                  D/F#    Asus  A
Through the way things appear, You're looking into my heart

   ————————— Chorus: ———————————————————————————————————————————
D                        AaddB
  I'm coming back to the heart of worship
         Em        D/F#      G         A6
And it's all about You, it's all about You Jesus
D                        AaddB
  I'm sorry Lord for the thing I've made it
          Em        D/F#      G         A6    D
When it's all about You, it's all about You Jesus

   ————————— Verse 2: ——————————————————————————————————————————
D                 A                     G
  King of endless worth, no one could express
               Asus  A
How much You deserve
D                     A                   G
  Though I'm weak and poor, all I have is Yours
             Asus   A
Every single breath
