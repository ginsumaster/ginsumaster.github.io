 <p>From doing right to doing wrong, 'cause we were taught that's who we are</p><br>
<h6>             C                            G</h6><br>

<h6>D                                                C</h6><br>
 <p>  We're on the edge of our seats saying it's too late</p><br>
<h6>                              G</h6><br>
 <p>Well let me introduce you to amazing grace</p><br>

<h3><sup><big>    ————————— Verse 2: ————————————————————————————————————————————————</big></sup></h3>
<h6>                  G</h6><br>
 <p>Could it possibly be  that we simply can't believe</p><br>
<h6>           D</h6><br>
 <p>That this  unconditional kind of love would be enough to</p><br>
<h6>C</h6><br>
 <p>  Take a filthy wretch like this and wrap him up in righteousness</p><br>
<h6>G</h6><br>
 <p>  But that's exactly what He did</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    ————————— Bridge 1: ———————————————————————————————————————————————</big></sup></h3>
<h6>D       C</h6><br>
 <p>Oooooo, Oooooo</p><br>
<h6>G</h6><br>
 <p>  Take a breath smile and say right here right now I'm okay</p><br>
<h6>  D          C          G</h6><br>
 <p>Because  the cross was enough</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    ————————— Bridge 2: ———————————————————————————————————————————————</big></sup></h3>
<h6>G                                               D</h6><br>
 <p>  No matter what they say or what you think you are</p><br>
 <p>The day you called His name</p><br>
<h6>            C                     G</h6><br>
 <p>He made you flawless, He made you flawless</p><br>
