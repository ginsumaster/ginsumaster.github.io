<h3><sup><big>    ————————— Verse 1: ———————————————————————————————————————————————————</big></sup></h3>
<p>The nails in Your hands, the nails in Your feet</p><br>
<p>They tell me how much You love me</p><br>
<p>The thorns in Your brow, they tell me how</p><br>
<p>You bore so much pain to love me</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    ————————— Pre-Chorus: ————————————————————————————————————————————————</big></sup></h3>
<p>Until when the heavens pass away</p><br>
<p>All Your scars will still remain</p><br>
<p>And forever they will say</p><br>
<p>Just how much You love me</p><br>
<p>So I want to say</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    ————————— Chorus: ————————————————————————————————————————————————————</big></sup></h3>
<p>Forever my love</p><br>
<p>Forever my heart</p><br>
<p>Forever my life is Yours</p><br>
<h3><sup><big>    ————————— Ending: ————————————————————————————————————————————————————</big></sup></h3>
<p>It's Yours</p><br>
