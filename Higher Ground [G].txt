   ————————— Verse 1: ——————————————————————————————————————————
             G              C
I'm pressing on, the upward way
                G              D
New heights I'm gain-ing every day
              G              C
Still praying as, I'm onward bound
              G       D6  D  G
Lord plant my feet on higher ground

   ————————— Chorus: ———————————————————————————————————————————
             G              C
Lord lift me up, and let me stand
            DM7/F#         G
By faith on hea-ven's tableland
         G                  C
A higher plane, than I have found
              G       D6  D  G
Lord plant my feet on higher ground

   ————————— Verse 2: ——————————————————————————————————————————
             G             C
My heart has no, desire to stay
              G                  D
Where doubts arise, and fears dismay
                G                   C
Though some may dwell, where these abound
             G      D6  D  G
My prayer my aim is higher ground

   ————————— Verse 3: ——————————————————————————————————————————
I want to live, above the world
Though Satan's darts, at me are hurled
For faith has caught, the joyful sound
The song of saints on higher ground

   ————————— Verse 4: ——————————————————————————————————————————
I want to scale, the utmost height
And catch a gleam, of glory bright
But still I'll pray, 'til heaven I've found
Lord lead me on to higher ground
