<h3><sup><big>    â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Verse 1: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”</big></sup></h3>
<p>In Christ alone my hope is found</p><br>
<p>He is my light my strength  my song</p><br>
<p>This Cornerstone this solid Ground</p><br>
<p>Firm through the fiercest drought  and storm</p><br>
<p>What heights of love what depths of peace</p><br>
<p>When fears are stilled when strivings cease</p><br>
<p>My Comforter my All in All</p><br>
<p>Here in the love of Christ  I stand</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Verse 2: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”</big></sup></h3>
<p>In Christ alone who took on flesh</p><br>
<p>Fullness of God in help  less babe</p><br>
<p>This gift of love and righteousness</p><br>
<p>Scorned by the ones He came  to save</p><br>
<p>Till on that cross as Jesus died</p><br>
<p>The wrath of God was satisfied</p><br>
<p>For every sin on Him was laid</p><br>
<p>Here in the death of Christ  I live</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Verse 3: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”</big></sup></h3>
<p>There in the ground His body lay</p><br>
<p>Light of the world by dark  ness slain</p><br>
<p>Then bursting forth in glorious Day</p><br>
<p>Up from the grave He rose again</p><br>
<p>And as He stands in victory</p><br>
<p>Sin's curse has lost its grip on me</p><br>
<p>For I am His and He is mine</p><br>
<p>Bought with the precious blood  of Christ</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Verse 4: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”</big></sup></h3>
<p>No guilt in life no fear in death</p><br>
<p>This is the power of Christ  in me</p><br>
<p>From life's first cry to final breath</p><br>
<p>Jesus commands my des  tiny</p><br>
<p>No power of hell no scheme of man</p><br>
<p>Can ever pluck me from His hand</p><br>
<p>Till He returns or calls me home</p><br>
<p>Here in the power of Christ  I'll stand</p><br>
