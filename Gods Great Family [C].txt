   ————————— Verse 1: ——————————————————————————————————————————
         D
When the Father  made us
             Bm
He knew we'd run from Him  and try to hide our sin
       D
But He wanted  to save us
             Bm
His own were on His heart  before He made the stars

   ————————— Chorus: ———————————————————————————————————————————
Bm  A    G         D      A        Bm
Oh, oh,  no one is good,  not even one
    G                          A               Bm
But God can make us daughters, God can make us sons
G              D             A              Bm
Jesus paid the price when He offered up His life
   Em                  G           A   D
So we could be part of God's great family.

   ————————— Verse 2: ——————————————————————————————————————————
         D
When the Father  draws us
            Bm
It's like a magnet's pull; He's irresistible
         D
When the Spirit  calls us
              Bm
He brings the dead to life  He gives the blind new eyes

A/C#    Bm                             G
When He calls,  when He draws,  we are His  forever
        A             Bm           G             D
He will never let you go,  He will never let you go
