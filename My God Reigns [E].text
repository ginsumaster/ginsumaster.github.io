There's nowhere else that I'd rather be
Than dancing with You as You sing over me
There's nothing else that I'd rather do
Lord than to worship You

So rejoice, be glad, rejoice O my soul
For the Lord, your God, He reigns forevermore
I rejoice, for my God reigns
So rejoice, be glad, your Father and your Friend
Is the Lord, your God, whose rule will never end
I rejoice, for my God reigns

My God reigns, and I dance the dance of praise
My God reigns, with a shout I will proclaim
My God reigns, and I worship without shame
My God reigns, and I will rejoice
(For) my God reigns
