           F                            C       G
A thousand times I've failed still Your mercy remains
             F                       C              G
And should I stumble again still I'm caught in Your grace
    Am           F                     C        G
Everlasting Your light will shine when all else fades
     Am          F            C        G
Neverending Your glory goes beyond all fame

Your will above all else my purpose remains

From the inside out Lord my soul cries out (Lord)
