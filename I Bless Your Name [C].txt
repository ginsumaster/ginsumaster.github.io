   G7sus      C       F/C               C        F/C  G/B      Am7  D7/F#
In pris'ners' chains,     with bleeding stripes,      Paul and Si-  las
            Gsus  G              C    F/C          C    G/B  Am
Prayed that night   and in their pain     began to sing
      Dm7(b5)/Ab  C/G    Gsus     G         Csus  C
Their chains were loosed      and they were free

I bless Your name,       I bless Your name

I give You hon- or, give You praise
    G/B     C     F                 C   G/B  Am
You are the life,    the truth, the way

I bless Your  name,      I bless Your name

Some midnight hour,     if you should find     you're in a pri- son
        Gsus  G                C       F/C            C  G/B  Am
In your mind,    reach out and praise,     defy those chains
    Dm7(b5)/Ab  C/G  Gsus     G      Csus  C
And they will   fall       in Jesus' name
