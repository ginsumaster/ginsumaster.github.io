<p>Dwelt among men my example is He</p><br>
<p>The Word became flesh and the light shined among us His glory revealed</p><br>
<br>

<p> One day they led Him up Calv'ry's mountain</p><br>
<p>One day they nailed Him to die on a tree</p><br>

<p>Now is ascended my Lord evermore</p><br>
<p>Death could not hold Him the grave could not keep Him from rising again</p><br>
