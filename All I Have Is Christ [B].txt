   ————————— Verse 1: ——————————————————————————————————————————
           F#              G#m                  E        G#m
I once was lost in darkest night  yet thought I knew the way
             C#m              E                F#     B
The sin that promised joy and life  had led me to the grave
         B                   E            E       G#m
I had no hope that You would own  a rebel to Your will
           B                E                E        F#
And if You had not loved me first  I would refuse You still

   ————————— Verse 2: ——————————————————————————————————————————
         F#                G#m               E      G#m
But as I ran my hell-bound race  indifferent to the cost
            C#m             E                 F#     B
You looked upon my helpless state  and led me to the cross
        B                  E                    E     G#m
And I beheld God's love displayed  You suffered in my place
             B                  E             E       F#
You bore the wrath reserved for me  now all I know is grace

   ————————— Chorus: ———————————————————————————————————————————
     E  B          F#      G#m
Hallelu-jah! All I have is Christ
     E  G#m        F#    B
Hallelu-jah! Jesus is my life

   ————————— Verse 3: ——————————————————————————————————————————
             F#              G#m               E         G#m
Now, Lord, I would be Yours alone  and live so all might see
                C#m            E                  F#        B
The strength to follow Your commands  could never come from me
          B               E            E       G#m
O Father, use my ransomed life  in any way You choose
           B            E           E        F#
And let my song forever be  my only boast is You
