   ————————— Verse 1: ——————————————————————————————————————————
D           A/C#                    Am/C           G/B
Long ago He blessed the earth, born older than the years
    Gm/Bb            D/A      Bm               Em            A7
And in the stall the Cross He saw, through the first of many tears
  D                A/C#            Am/C            G/B
A life of homeless wandering, cast out in sorrow's way
    Gm/Bb            D/A     Bm        Em                Em/A  A
The Shepherd seeking for the lost, His life the price He paid

   ————————— Chorus 1: —————————————————————————————————————————
     D          F#m       G            D/F#
Love crucified arose, the Risen One in splendor
  G              D/F#        Em           A7
Jehovah's sole Defender, has won the victory
     D          F#m           G              D/F#
Love crucified arose, and the grave became a place of hope
        G                  D/F#   Bm        Em      A7    D
For the heart that sin and sorrow broke, is beating once again

   ————————— Verse 2: ——————————————————————————————————————————
       D                 A/C#                Am/C               G/B
Throughout Your life You felt the weight, of what You'd come to give
   Gm/Bb             D/A     Bm           Em              A7
To drink for us that crimson cup, so that we might really live
   D                A/C#              Am/C           G/B
At last the time to love and die, the dark appointed day
     Gm/Bb        D/A    Bm         Em                Em/A  A
That one forsaken moment when, Your Father turned His face away

   ————————— Chorus 2: —————————————————————————————————————————
     D          F#m       G                 D/F#
Love crucified arose, the One Who lived and died for me
    G                    D/F#               Em              A7
Was Satan's nail-pierced casualty, now He's breathing once again
     D          F#m           G              D/F#
Love crucified arose, and the grave became a place of hope
        G                  D/F#   Bm        Em      A7    D
For the heart that sin and sorrow broke, is beating once again
