What love could remember, no wrongs we have done
  G             Am          F                Gsus
Omniscient, all-knowing, He counts not their sum
       C      Dm7         C/E       F
Thrown into a sea without bottom or shore

Our  sins they are many, His mer-  cy  is    more

What Father so tender is calling us home
   C            Dm7          C/E         F
He welcomes the weakest, the vilest, the poor

What riches of kindness He lavished on us
    G             Am          F            Gsus
His blood was the payment His life was the cost
   C              Dm7           C/E     F
We stood 'neath a debt we could never afford
C/E  F             C/G       Gsus  G6    C
Our  sins they are many, His mer-  cy is more
