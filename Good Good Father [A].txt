A            Asus     A5         A         Asus         A5
I've heard a thousand stories of what they think You're like
    A              Asus   A5         A           Asus    A5
But I've heard the tender whisper of love in the dead of night
    D2      A/C#                         Bm7        E4
You tell me that You're pleased and that I'm never alone

                   D2                      A
You're a good good Father it's who You are
                 Bm7                  E4
It's who You are     it's who You are
                 D2                A
And I'm loved by You it's who I am
              Bm7               E4
It's who I am     it's who I am

A         Asus  A5            A       Asus    A5
I've seen many  searching for answers far and wide
    A      Asus      A5            A            Asus   A5
But I know we're all searching for answers only You provide
            D2        A/C#                Bm7           E4
Because You know just what we need before we say a word

You are perfect in all of Your ways
        Bm7                    A    E/G#
You are perfect in all of Your ways
        D2                     F#m7    E4
You are perfect in all of Your ways to us

A       Asus  A5     A     Asus   A5
Love so unde- niable I can hardly speak
A        Asus  A5        A     Asus   A5
Peace so unex- plainable I can hardly think
       D2      A/C#                Bm7
As You call me deeper still as You call me deeper still
       D2      A/C#              Bm7       E4
As You call me deeper still into love love love
