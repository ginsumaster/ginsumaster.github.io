F              Dm          Gm
  He turned my darkness to dancing
C                     Bb   F     C/E  Dm
  He turned my sorrow all around
                                   G
I never thought that I could live again
        Bb
But His grace abounds
And my life I have found
      Dm
Now I cannot help singing
     Am
He's shattered my chains,
    Bb                         F/C  C
I'm walking in the land of the liv- ing
A              Dm
So I'll praise Him
    D          F/C       Dm/B
And worship my Savior, Redeemer
    Gm      Csus  C  F
And glorify Jesus my King
