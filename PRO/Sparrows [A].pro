{soh}Verse 1:{eoh}
The [D]sparrow's not worried 'bout [E]tomorrow   or the [A]troubles  to [F#m]come
The [D]lily's not thinking 'bout the [E]seasons  the [A]drought or  the flood
A [D]tree that's planted by the [E]water  isn't [A]fazed by  the [F#m]fire
[D] So why should [E]I  be [A]

{soh}Chorus:{eoh}
'Cause You take good care of [D]me  You take good care of [E]me
You know what I [A/C#]need  before I even ask a [F#m]thing
You hold me [E]in Your [D]hands  with a kindness that never [E]ends
I'm carried in Your [A/C#]love  no matter what the future [F#m]brings
You take good [E]care of me

{soh}Verse 2:{eoh}
The [D]sun's not worried 'bout the [E]winter  'cause [A]soon it will pass
The [D]light's not thinking 'bout the [E]darkness  or the [A]shadow it casts
A [D]heart that's planted in forgive[E]ness  doesn't [A]dwell in the [F#m]past
[D] So why should [E]I  be [A] 

{soh}Channel:{eoh}
| [A] [F#m] | [D]     | [E] [F#m] | [D]     |

{soh}Bridge: -- do 2x{eoh}
[E] I know there [F#m]must be more     [D] but I can't get past Your kindness
[E] I know there's [F#m]got to be more [D] but I can't get past Your goodness
