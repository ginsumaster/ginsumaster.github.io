   ————————— Verse 1: ——————————————————————————————————————————
D     A/D       G/D             D
Jesus Christ, I think upon Your sacrifice
G          D/F#     G         Asus  A
You became nothing, poured to death
D    A/D         G/D              D
Many times, I've wondered at Your gift of life
    G           Asus        A    D
And I'm in that place once again
    G           Asus        A    D
    I'm in that place once again

   ————————— Chorus: ———————————————————————————————————————————
D/F#         G             D/F#            Asus  A
Once again I look upon the cross where You died
    D/F#            G             D/F#     Asus  A
I'm humbled by Your mercy and I'm broken inside
Bm7          G          D/F#         A           G    Asus  A  D
Once again I thank You, once again I pour out my life

   ————————— Verse 2: ——————————————————————————————————————————
D       A/D   G/D          D
Now You are exalted to the highest place
G           D/F#           G            Asus  A
King of the heavens, where one day I'll bow
D       A/D    G/D            D
But for now, I marvel at Your saving grace
    G           Asus         A    D
And I'm full of praise once again
    G           Asus         A    D
    I'm full of praise once again

Thank You for the cross    Thank You for the cross
G                 Asus   A  D
Thank You for the cross, my friend (X2)
