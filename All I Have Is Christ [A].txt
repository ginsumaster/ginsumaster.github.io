   ————————— Verse 1: ——————————————————————————————————————————
           E               F#m                  D        F#m
I once was lost in darkest night  yet thought I knew the way
             Bm               D                E      A
The sin that promised joy and life  had led me to the grave
         A                   D            D       F#m
I had no hope that You would own  a rebel to Your will
           A                D                D        E
And if You had not loved me first  I would refuse You still

   ————————— Verse 2: ——————————————————————————————————————————
         E                 F#m               D      F#m
But as I ran my hell-bound race  indifferent to the cost
            Bm              D                 E      A
You looked upon my helpless state  and led me to the cross
        A                  D                    D     F#m
And I beheld God's love displayed  You suffered in my place
             A                  D             D       E
You bore the wrath reserved for me  now all I know is grace

   ————————— Chorus: ———————————————————————————————————————————
     D  A          E       F#m
Hallelu-jah! All I have is Christ
     D  F#m        E     A
Hallelu-jah! Jesus is my life

   ————————— Verse 3: ——————————————————————————————————————————
             E               F#m               D         F#m
Now, Lord, I would be Yours alone  and live so all might see
                Bm             D                  E         A
The strength to follow Your commands  could never come from me
          A               D            D       F#m
O Father, use my ransomed life  in any way You choose
           A            D           D        E
And let my song forever be  my only boast is You
