   ————————— Verse 1: ——————————————————————————————————————————
C       Am     F2            G
Amazing grace, how sweet the sound
C       Am    F2          G
Amazing love, now flowing sound
F              G
From hands and feet
          E/G#          Am   G
That were nailed to the tree
F               G               Csus  C
His grace flows down and covers me

       F2  Gsus  G
Covers me
       F2  Gsus  G
Covers me
           C  Am  F  G
And covers me
