   ————————— Verse 1: ——————————————————————————————————————————
D                                  G
I was an orphan, lost at the fall, running away when I'd hear your call
D                                  G
  But Father, You worked Your will
D                                 G
I had no righteousness of my own, I had no right to draw near Your throne
D                                G
  But Father, You loved me still

   ————————— Chorus 1: —————————————————————————————————————————
       A                Bm                   G
And in love, before you laid the world's foundation
       A            Bm              G
You predestined to adopt me as Your own
         A               Bm            G
You have raised me up so high above my station
      A               Bm               G
I'm a child of God by grace and grace alone

   ————————— Verse 2: ——————————————————————————————————————————
D                                        G
You left your home to seek out the lost, You knew the great and terrible cost
D                              G
  But Jesus, Your face was set
D                                     G
I worked my fingers down to the bone, nothing I did could ever atone
D                             G
  But Jesus, You paid my debt

   ————————— Chorus 2: —————————————————————————————————————————
        A              Bm              G
By Your blood I have redemption and salvation
         A                 Bm                 G
Lord You died that I might reap what You have sown
        A                 Bm          G
And You rose that I might be a new creation
     A             Bm               G
I am born again by grace and grace alone

F#m                                   G
    I was in darkness all of my life, I never knew the day from the night
A                 F#m         G
  But Spirit, You made me see
F#m                               G
I swore I knew the way on my own, head full of rocks, a heart made of stone
A                 F#m         G
  But Spirit, You moved in me

   ————————— Chorus 3: —————————————————————————————————————————
            D                              G
And at Your touch, my sleeping spirit was awakened
      Bm                                      G
On my darkened heart, the light of Christ has shone
         D            Em             G
Called into a kingdom that cannot be shaken
         Bm         A                G
Heaven's citizen by grace and grace alone

        A                 Bm               G
So I'll stand in faith by grace and grace alone
       A               Bm               G
I will run the race by grace and grace alone
       A              Bm               G
I will slay my sin by grace and grace alone
       A             Bm               G    D
I will reach the end grace and grace alone
