<p>Were creation suddenly articulate  with a thousand tongues to lift one cry</p><br>
<p>Then from north  to south  and east  to west  we'd hear Christ be magnified</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Verse 2: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”</big></sup></h3>
<p>Were the whole earth echoing His eminence  His name  would  burst from sea and sky</p><br>

<br>
<h3><sup><big>    â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Chorus: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”</big></sup></h3>

<br>

<p>I won't bow to idols  I'll stand strong and worship You</p><br>
<p>If it puts me in the fire  I'll rejoice 'cause You're there too</p><br>
<p>I won't be formed by feelings  I'll hold fast to what is true</p><br>
<p>If the cross brings transformation  then I'll be crucified with You</p><br>
<p>'Cause death is just the doorway  into resurrection life</p><br>
<p>If I join You in Your sufferings  then I'll join You when You rise</p><br>
<p>And when You return in glory  with all the angels and the saints</p><br>
<p>My heart will still be singing  my song will be the same</p><br>
