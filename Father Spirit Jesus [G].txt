G                                                    Dm
Lord the worship we bring is more than songs that we sing

For we are children of the King, sing

You are worthy of all honor, glory, praise, and power
C2                   G                    D
King of the nations.   You are holy God Almighty
                     Am       C2              G
Clothed in brilliant majesty: Father, Spirit, Jesus
