D                                E
I won't bow to idols  I'll stand strong and worship You

If it puts me in the fire  I'll rejoice 'cause You're there too

I won't be formed by feelings  I'll hold fast to what is true

If the cross brings transformation  then I'll be crucified with You

'Cause death is just the doorway  into resurrection life

If I join You in Your sufferings  then I'll join You when You rise
         D                                 E
And when You return in glory  with all the angels and the saints
   F#m                             E
My heart will still be singing  my song will be the same
