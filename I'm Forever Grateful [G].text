You did not wait for me to draw near to You
But You clothed Yourself with frail humanity
You did not wait for me to cry out to You
But You let me hear Your voice calling me

And I'm forever grateful to You
And I'm forever grateful for the cross
And I'm forever grateful  to You
That You came  to seek and save the lost
