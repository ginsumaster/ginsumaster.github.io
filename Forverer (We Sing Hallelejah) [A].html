<h3><sup><big>    ————————— Verse 1: ———————————————————————————————————————————————————</big></sup></h3>
<p> The moon and stars they wept the morning sun was dead</p><br>
<p>The Savior of the world was fallen</p><br>
<p> His body on the cross His blood poured out for us</p><br>
<p>The weight of every curse upon Him</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    ————————— Instr: —————————————————————————————————————————————————————</big></sup></h3>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    ————————— Verse 2: ———————————————————————————————————————————————————</big></sup></h3>
<p> One final breath He gave as heaven looked away</p><br>
<p>The Son of God was laid in darkness</p><br>
<p> A battle in the grave the war on death was waged</p><br>
<p>The power of hell forever broken</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    ————————— Pre-Chorus: ————————————————————————————————————————————————</big></sup></h3>
<p> The ground began to shake the stone was rolled away</p><br>
<p>His (perfect) (reckless) love could not be overcome</p><br>
<p> Now death where is your sting our resurrected King</p><br>
<p>Has rendered you defeated</p><br>
<h3><sup><big>    ————————— Chorus: ————————————————————————————————————————————————————</big></sup></h3>
<p>Now forever He is glorified   forever He is lifted high</p><br>
<p>And forever He is risen   He is alive and He is alive</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    ————————— Bridge: ————————————————————————————————————————————————————</big></sup></h3>
<p> We sing hallelujah we sing hallelujah</p><br>
<p>We sing hallelujah the Lamb has overcome</p><br>
<p>(REPEAT)</p><br>
<p> We sing hallelujah we sing hallelujah we sing hallelujah</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    ————————— Ending: ————————————————————————————————————————————————————</big></sup></h3>
<p> And now death where is your sting our resurrected King has overcome</p><br>
<p>He's overcome oh</p><br>
