D            Dsus     D5         D         Dsus         D5
I've heard a thousand stories of what they think You're like
    D              Dsus   D5         D           Dsus    D5
But I've heard the tender whisper of love in the dead of night
    G2      D/F#                         Em7        A4
You tell me that You're pleased and that I'm never alone

                   G2                      D
You're a good good Father it's who You are
                 Em7                  A4
It's who You are     it's who You are
                 G2                D
And I'm loved by You it's who I am
              Em7               A4
It's who I am     it's who I am

I've seen many  searching for answers far and wide
    D      Dsus      D5            D            Dsus   D5
But I know we're all searching for answers only You provide
            G2        D/F#                Em7           A4
Because You know just what we need before we say a word

You are perfect in all of Your ways
        Em7                    D    A/C#
You are perfect in all of Your ways
        G2                     F#m7    A4
You are perfect in all of Your ways to us

D       Dsus  D5     D     Dsus   D5
Love so unde- niable I can hardly speak
D        Dsus  D5        D     Dsus   D5
Peace so unex- plainable I can hardly think
       G2      D/F#                Em7
As You call me deeper still as You call me deeper still
       G2      D/F#              Em7       A4
As You call me deeper still into love love love
