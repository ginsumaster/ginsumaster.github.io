   ————————— Verse 1: ——————————————————————————————————————————
G      D/F#   Em       D
  Open up the skies of mercy
G          D/F#     Em        D
  And rain down the cleansing flood
G         D/F#   Em    D
  Healing waters rise around us
C                          D
  And hear our cries Lord.   Let 'em rise.

   ————————— Chorus: ———————————————————————————————————————————
              C        G          Am
And it's Your kindness Lord, that leads us to repentance
     C     G             Am
Your favor Lord is our desire
          C      G          Am
It's Your beauty Lord, that makes us stand in silence
         C          D                    G    Am  C
And Your love, Your love, is better than life

   ————————— Verse 2: ——————————————————————————————————————————
G        D/F#      Em    D
  We can feel Your mercy falling
G         D/F#        Em           D
  You are turning our hearts back again
G          D/F#    Em      D
  Hear our praises rise to heaven
C                        D
  And draw us near Lord.   Meet us here.
