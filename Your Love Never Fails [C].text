Nothing can separate  even if I ran away
Your love never fails
I know I still make mistakes  but  You have new mercies for me ev'ryday
Your love never fails

(And) You stay the same through the ages  Your love never chang-es
There may be pain in the night  but joy comes in the morn-ing

And when the oceans rage  I don't have to be a-fraid
Because I know that You love me
Your love never fails

The chasm is far too wide  I never thought I'd reach the other side
'Cause Your love never fails
