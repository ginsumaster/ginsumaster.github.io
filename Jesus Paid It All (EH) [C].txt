  C                         G7/B               C
I hear the Savior say, "Thy strength indeed is small.
         C/A                F             G        G6     C
Child of weakness watch and pray. Find in Me thine all in all.""

   ————————— Chorus: ———————————————————————————————————————————
C             F/A  C/G          G
Jesus paid it all; all to Him I owe
C              F                 C/G       G6       C
Sin had left a crimson stain; He washed it white as snow

     C                      G7/B             C
Lord now indeed I find, Thy power and Thine alone
    C/A                F          G        G6       C
Can change the leper's spots, and melt the heart of stone

I'll wash my garments white, in the blood of Calvary's Lamb

And when before the throne, I stand in Him complete

Jesus died my soul to save, my lips shall still repeat
