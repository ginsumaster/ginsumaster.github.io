Before I spoke a word, You were singing over me
You have been so, so good  to me
Before I took a breath,  You breathed Your life in me
You have been so, so kind  to me

â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Chorus: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”
O, the overwhelming, never-ending, reckless love  of God
O, it chases me down, fights 'til I'm found, leaves  the ninety-nine
I couldn't earn it, I don't deserve it, still You give Yourself away
O, the overwhelming, never-ending, reckless love  of God, yeah

â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Verse 2: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”
When I was Your foe,  still Your love fought  for me
You have been so, so good  to me
When I felt no worth,  You paid it all  for me
You have been so, so kind  to me

There's no shadow You won't light up  Mountain You won't climb up  coming after me
There's no wall You won't kick down  Lie You won't tear down  coming after me

Lie You won't tear down  coming after me
