<p>Lord I come</p><br>

<p> I bring an offering of worship to my King</p><br>

<p> Over the skies of Bethlehem appeared a star</p><br>
<p> While angels sang to lowly shepherds</p><br>
<p> Three wise men seeking truth traveled from afar</p><br>
<p> Hoping to find the Child from heaven</p><br>
<p>Falling on their knees they bowed before the humble</p><br>
<p>Prince of Peace</p><br>
