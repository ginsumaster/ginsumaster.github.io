<h3><sup><big>    ————————— Verse 1: ————————————————————————————————————————————————</big></sup></h3>
<h6>  G                  D  G</h6><br>
 <p>I come to the garden a- lone,</p><br>
<h6>          C      Am    C      G</h6><br>
 <p>While the dew is still on the roses</p><br>
<h6>        D7                   G  D  G</h6><br>
 <p>And the voice I hear falling on my ear,</p><br>
<h6>    A             D</h6><br>
 <p>The Son of God discloses</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    ————————— Chorus 1: ———————————————————————————————————————————————</big></sup></h3>
<h6>       G                     D7</h6><br>
 <p>And He walks with me, and He talks with me</p><br>
<h6>       D7                G</h6><br>
 <p>And He tells me I am His own</p><br>
<h6>        G      B7          Em    C</h6><br>
 <p>And the joy we share as we tarry there</p><br>
<h6>     G         D    G</h6><br>
 <p>None other has ever known</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    ————————— Verse 2: ————————————————————————————————————————————————</big></sup></h3>
<h6>   G                       D   G</h6><br>
 <p>He speaks and the sound of His voice</p><br>
<h6>      C         Am    C          G</h6><br>
 <p>Is so sweet the birds hush their singing</p><br>
<h6>        D7             G    D  G</h6><br>
 <p>And the melody that He gave to me</p><br>
<h6>    A              D</h6><br>
 <p>Within my heart is ringing</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    ————————— Verse 3: ————————————————————————————————————————————————</big></sup></h3>
<h6>    G                  D    G</h6><br>
 <p>I'd stay in the garden with Him</p><br>
<h6>         C      Am    C     G</h6><br>
 <p>Tho' the night around me be falling</p><br>
<h6>       D7                   G     D  G</h6><br>
 <p>But He bids me go thro' the voice of woe</p><br>
<h6>    A              D</h6><br>
 <p>His voice to me is calling</p><br>
