   ————————— Verse 1: ——————————————————————————————————————————
Am                           F6             C
   There's a grace, when the heart is under fire
Am                      F6                C
   Another way when the walls are closing in
Am                        F6                     C                    G/C
   And when I look at the space between  where I used to be  and this reckoning
Am                F6             C
   I know  I will never be  alone

   ————————— Chorus 1: —————————————————————————————————————————
                          Am     F6                C
There was another  in the fire,  standing  next to me
                          Am       F6               C
There was another  in the waters,  holding back the seas
                          Am          F                 C
And should I ever  need reminding  of how I've been set free
                                Am             F6              C
There is a cross that bears the burden  where another died for me
                         Am   F6  C
There is another  in the fire

   ————————— Interlude 1: ——————————————————————————————————————

   ————————— Verse 2: ——————————————————————————————————————————
Am                      F6                C
   All my debt left for dead beneath  the waters
Am                  F6                  C
   I'm no longer  a slave to my sin  any-more
Am                           F6                    C                     Em7
   And should I fall  in the space between  what remains of me  and this reckoning
Am                     F6                           C
   Either way  I won't bow  to the things  of this  world
Am                   F6             C
   And I know I will never be  alone

   ————————— Chorus 2: —————————————————————————————————————————
                         Am     F6               C
There is another  in the fire,  standing next to me
                         Am       F6               C
There is another  in the waters,  holding back the seas
                          Am             F             C
And should I ever  need reminding,  what powers set me free
                               Am             F6             C
There is a grave that holds no body  now that power lives in me
                         Am   F6  C
There is another  in the fire

   ————————— Tag 1: ————————————————————————————————————————————
                        Am    F6   C
There is another in the fire, whoa ooh

                    Am            F                 C                G
And I can see  the  light  in the darkness,  as the darkness bows to Him
                 Am           F                C/E                 G
I can hear  the  roar  in the heavens,  as the space between wears thin
                Am              F                 C/E               G
I can feel the  ground  shake beneath us,  as the prison walls cave in
                Dm                         F        G
Nothing stays between us,  nothing stays between us

   ————————— Verse 3: ——————————————————————————————————————————
Am                   F6                         C
   There is no other name, but the name that is Jesus
Am                       F6                          C
   He who was  and still is,  and will be through it all
Am                         F6                     C                      G/C
   So come what may in the space between  all the things unseen  and His reckoning
Am               F6         C      Am               F6            C
   I know I will never be  alone,     I know I will never be alone

   ————————— Chorus 3: —————————————————————————————————————————
                            Am     F6               C
There'll be another  in the fire,  standing next to me
                            Am       F6               C
There'll be another  in the waters,  holding back the seas
                          Am            F                   C
And should I ever  need reminding,  how good You've been to me
T:                               Am               F6                          C
   I'll count the joy from every battle,  cause I know that's where You'll be

   ————————— Tag 2: ————————————————————————————————————————————
               Am       F6             C
But even if He doesn't,    I'll praise Him
           Am        F6          C
Even if He doesn't,  I'll stand  tall
