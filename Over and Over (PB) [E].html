<p>The wind is beginning to blow, I can feel it, I can feel it.</p><br>
<p>The river is starting to flow, I can hear it, I can hear it.</p><br>
<p>These are the days,  the days of Your presence</p><br>
<p>Seasons of change,  times of refreshing</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Chorus: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”</big></sup></h3>
<p>Over and over, let Your mercy cover me;</p><br>
<p>Over and over, let Your river run through me;</p><br>
<p>O, Holy Spirit, pour down like rain;</p><br>
<p>Over and over again</p><br>
