<h3><sup><big>    â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Chorus: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”</big></sup></h3>
<p>God will make a way</p><br>
<p>Where there seems to be no way,</p><br>
<p>He works in ways we cannot see,</p><br>
<p>He will make a way for me;</p><br>
<p>He will be my guide,</p><br>
<p>Hold me closely to His side,</p><br>
<p>With love and strength for each new day,</p><br>
<p>He will make a way, He will make a way</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Verse 1: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”</big></sup></h3>
<p>By a roadway in the wilderness He'll lead me</p><br>
<p>And rivers in the desert will I see;</p><br>
<p>Heaven and earth will fade</p><br>
<p>But His Word will still remain,</p><br>
<p>He will do something new today</p><br>
