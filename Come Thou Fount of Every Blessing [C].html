<p>Come Thou fount of every blessing,  tune my heart to sing Thy grace</p><br>
<p>Streams of mercy never ceasing,     call for songs of loudest praise</p><br>
<p>Teach me some melodious sonnet      sung by flaming tongues above</p><br>
<p>Praise His name I'm fixed upon it,  name of God's redeeming love</p><br>
<br>

<p>Hither-to Thy love has blest me,    thou hast bro't me to this place</p><br>
<p>And I know Thy hand will bring me,  safely home by Thy good grace</p><br>
<p>Jesus sought me when a stranger,    wand'ring from the fold of God</p><br>
<p>He to rescue me from danger,        bo't me with His precious blood</p><br>
<br>

<p>O to grace how great a debtor       daily I'm constrained to be!</p><br>
<p>Let Thy goodness like a fetter      bind my wand'ring heart to Thee</p><br>
<p>Prone to wander Lord I feel it      prone to leave the God I love</p><br>
<p>Here's my heart O take and seal it  seal it for Thy courts above</p><br>
