   ————————— Verse 1: ——————————————————————————————————————————
C
When I survey the wondrous Cross
On which the Prince of Glory died
My richest gain, I count but loss
And pour contempt on all my pride

C

Sorrow and love flow mingled down
Did ever such love and sorrow meet?
Or thorns compose, so rich a crown

Oh the wonderful cross, oh the wonderful cross
        F                C/E             G
Bids me come and die and find that I may truly live
       F         C/E           F         C/E
Oh the wonderful cross, oh the wonderful cross

All who gather here by grace, draw near and bless Your name

Were the whole realm of nature mine
That were an offering far too small
Love so amazing, so divine
Demands my soul, my life, my all
