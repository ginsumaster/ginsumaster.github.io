   ————————— Verse 1: ——————————————————————————————————————————
     G                     Em7
Your blood speaks a better word
                   G                           Em7
Than all the empty claims I've heard upon this earth.
                     D                      C                       G      D  C
Speaks righteous for me, and stands in my defense.  Jesus it's Your blood.

Your cross testifies in grace
                      G                       Em7
Tells of the Father's heart to make a way for us
                D                        C                         G      D  C
Now boldly we approach, not earthly confidence.  It's only by Your blood.
