   ————————— Verse 1: ——————————————————————————————————————————
    E                        C#m7
The nails in Your hands, the nails in Your feet
A2                        Bsus    B
They tell me how much You love me
    E                    C#m7
The thorns in Your brow, they tell me how
    A2                   Bsus    B
You bore so much pain to love me

   ————————— Pre-Chorus: ———————————————————————————————————————
               G#m           C#m
Until when the heavens pass away
         G#m                C#m
All Your scars will still remain
       G#m            C#m
And forever they will say
     A            B
Just how much You love me
     A/B     B
So I want to say

   ————————— Chorus: ———————————————————————————————————————————
   E
Forever my love
   C#m7
Forever my heart
   A2              B
Forever my life is Yours
   ————————— Ending: ———————————————————————————————————————————
     E
It's Yours
