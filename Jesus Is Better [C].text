In all my sorrows,     Jesus is better make my heart believe
In all my victories,   Jesus is better make my heart believe
Than any comfort,      Jesus is better make my heart believe
More than all riches,  Jesus is better make my heart believe
Our souls declaring,   Jesus is better make my heart believe
Our song eternal,      Jesus is better make my heart believe
