There's a hunger, deep inside my soul
C    G       F  C             E         /G#     Am     /G
Only in Your presence, are my heart and flesh restored

How lovely is Your dwelling place

F                      C                F                C
In Your courts there's shelter, for the greatest and the small
    Dm            F                  C    Dm/C  C
The sparrow has a place to build her nest

The pilgrim finds refreshment, in the rains that fall

A single day is better, when spent in humble praise

Than a thousand days, of living without You

The Lord bestows His favor, on each one who obeys

And blessings on the man, whose heart is true
