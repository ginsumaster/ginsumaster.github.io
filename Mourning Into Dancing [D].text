Where there once was only hurt
He gave His healing hand
Where there once was only pain
He brought comfort like a friend
I feel the sweetness of His love
Piercing my darkness
I see the bright and morning sun
As it ushers in His joyful gladness

He's turned my mourning into dancing again
He's lifted my sorrows;  I can't stay silent
I must sing for His joy has come

But His favor is here
And will be on me for all my lifetime
