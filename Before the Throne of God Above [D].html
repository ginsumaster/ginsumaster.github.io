<p>Before the throne of God above  I have a strong and perfect plea</p><br>

<p>I know that while in heav'n He stands  No tongue can bid me thence depart</p><br>
<p>                                          No tongue can bid me thence depart</p><br>

<p>When Satan tempts me to despair  And tells me of the guilt within</p><br>
<p>Upward I look and see Him there   Who made an end to all my sin</p><br>
<p>Because the sinless Saviour died   My sinful soul is counted free</p><br>

<p>Behold Him there the risen Lamb  My perfect spotless righteousness</p><br>
<p>The great unchangeable I Am  The King of glory and of grace</p><br>

<p>My life is hid with Christ on high  With Christ my Saviour and my God</p><br>
<p>                                     With Christ my Saviour and my God</p><br>

<p>I bow before the cross of Christ  And marvel at this love divine</p><br>
<p>God's perfect Son was sacrificed  To make me righteous in God's eyes</p><br>
<p>This river's depths I cannot know   But I can glory in its flood</p><br>
<p>The Lord Most High has bowed down low  And poured on me His glorious love</p><br>
<p>                                         And poured on me His glorious love</p><br>
