Holiness is Your life in me
Making me clean through Your blood

Purging my heart like a flood

Only the blood of Jesus,  covers all of my sins
Only the life of Jesus,  renews me from within
Your blood is enough,  Your mercy complete
Your work of atonement
Paid for my debts, making me holy
Only the blood of Jesus
