  D   Em7  G  A         D       Em7  G  A
I waited,       for the Lord on high
  D   Em7  G                    D  Em7  G  A
I waited,       and He heard my cry (X2)

   ————————— Verse 1: ——————————————————————————————————————————
   Bm            A/C#    D
He pulled me out      of my despair,
   Bm              A    G
He showed me where   to walk
     Bm        A/C#   D
From fear into      security,
     Bm        A      G    A
From quicksand   to a rock

     Bm          A/C#     D
I'll sing to let      the people know,

That I have been   restored
Bm              A/C#     D
They will kneel      and understand,
     Bm             A        G    A
To return and trust   in the Lord

There's a new song,     in my heart to sing

        A new song,     praises for  my  King    (X2)
