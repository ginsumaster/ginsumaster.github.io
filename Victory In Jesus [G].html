<h3><sup><big>    â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Verse 1: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”</big></sup></h3>
<p>I heard an old  old story  how a Savior came  from glory</p><br>
<p>How He gave His life on Calvary  to save a wretch like me</p><br>
<p>I heard about  His groaning  of His precious blood's atoning</p><br>
<p>Then I repented of my sins and won the victory</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Chorus: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”</big></sup></h3>
<p>O victory  in Jesus  my Savior  forever</p><br>
<p>He sought me  and bought me  with His redeeming blood</p><br>
<p>He loved me ere  I knew Him  and all my love  is due Him</p><br>
<p>He plunged me  to victory  beneath the cleansing flood</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Verse 2: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”</big></sup></h3>
<p>I heard about  His healing  of His cleansing pow'r revealing</p><br>
<p>How He made the lame to walk again and caused the blind to see</p><br>
<p>And then I cried dear Jesus come and heal my broken spirit</p><br>
<p>And somehow Jesus came and brought to me the victory</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Verse 3: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”</big></sup></h3>
<p>I heard about a mansion He has built for me in glory</p><br>
<p>And I heard about the streets of gold beyond the crystal sea</p><br>
<p>About the angels singing and the old redemption story</p><br>
<p>And some sweet day I'll sing up there the song of victory</p><br>
