B                                    E2
  Into marvelous light I'm running,     out of darkness, out of shame

     By the cross You are the Truth, You are the Life, You are the Way

   ————————— Verse 1: ——————————————————————————————————————————
B                                E2
  I once was fatherless,         a stranger with no hope
B                                E2
  Your kindness wakened me,      wakened me  from my sleep
B                                E2
  Your love it beckons deeply,      a call to come and die
B                                E2
  By grace now I will come,  and take this life,  take Your life

   ————————— Pre-Chorus: ———————————————————————————————————————
G#m7         F#                    E2
     Sin has lost its power,          death has lost its sting
G#m7          F#                   E
     From the grave You've risen,    victoriously

   ————————— Chorus: ———————————————————————————————————————————
B                                    E2
  Into marvelous light I'm running,     out of darkness, out of shame
G#m7                  F#                 E2
     By the cross You are the Truth, You are the Life, You are the Way

   ————————— Verse 2: ——————————————————————————————————————————
B                                E2
  My dead heart now is beating,     my deepest stains now clean
B                                E2
  Your breath fills up my lungs, now I'm free, now I'm free

   ————————— Bridge: ———————————————————————————————————————————
B                                E2
  Lift my hands and spin around,    see that light  that I have found
G#m7        F#                E2
     Oh the marvelous light,  marvelous light
