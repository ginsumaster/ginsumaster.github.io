   ————————— Verse 1: ——————————————————————————————————————————
E2                                (B)
   We will give ourselves no rest
A
  Till Your kingdom comes on earth
F#m                                   E
    You're positioned watchmen on the walls

E2                                      (B)
   Now our prayers will flow like tears
A
  For You're shared Your heart with us
F#m                                E
    God of heaven, on our knees we fall

   ————————— Pre-Chorus: ———————————————————————————————————————
     A       B        A                B
Come down in power, reveal your heart again
     A        B          A                    Bsus  B
Come hear our cries; the tears that plead for rain

   ————————— Chorus: ———————————————————————————————————————————
      E
We're knocking, knocking on the door of heaven
      C#m7
We're crying, crying for this generation
      F#m7                              A            B
We're praying for Your name to be known   in all the earth
      E
We're watching, watching on the walls to see You
      C#m7
We're looking, looking for a time of breakthrough
      F#m7
We're praying for Your word to bear fruit
A               B                    E
  In all of the earth, in all of the earth
