I come in simplicity  longing for purity
To worship You  in spirit and truth  only You
Lord strip it all  away  'til only You  remain
I'm coming back  unto my first love  only You

Yes my heart will sing  how I love You

I come with my broken song,  to You the perfect One
To worship You  in spirit and truth,  only You (only You)
Give me a childlike heart,  lead me to where  You are
'Cause I'm coming back,  unto my first love  only You
