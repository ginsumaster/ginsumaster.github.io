   ————————— Verse 1: ——————————————————————————————————————————
A                      D        A           E           A
These are the days of Elijah, declaring the Word of the Lord
    A                          D2
And these are the days of Your servant, Moses,
A             E       A
Righteousness being restored
    C#m                                F#m
And though these are the days of great trials,
   Bm         D            E
Of famine and darkness and sword
      A                       D
Still we are the voice in the desert, crying,
    A           E          A
"Prepare ye the way of the Lord!"

   ————————— Chorus: ———————————————————————————————————————————
  E        A                   D
Behold, He comes riding on the clouds
                 A                   E
Shining like the sun, at the trumpet call
             A                           D
So lift your voice; it's the Year of Jubilee
                  A       E      A
And out of Zion's hill salvation comes!

   ————————— Verse 2: ——————————————————————————————————————————
A                      D           A           E         A
These are the days of Ezekiel, the dry bones becoming as flesh
    A                          D2
And these are the days of Your servant, David,
  A          E         A
Rebuilding a temple of praise
C#m                       F#m
These are the days of the harvest,
    D             Bm            E
The fields are as white in Your world
    A                    D
And we are the labourers in Your vineyard,
  A          E             A
Declaring the  Word of the Lord!

A                              D
  There's no god like Jehovah!   There's no god like Jehovah!
A                              E
  There's no god like Jehovah!   There's no god like Jehovah!
