G                   Am7
No eye has seen and no ear has heard,
    G/B                 CaddA  Dsus  D
And no mind has ever conceived
    G                    Am7
The glorious things that You have prepared
    G/B                Dsus  D
For ev'ryone who has believed;
F                           A/E            A
You brought us near and You called us Your own,
    Am7                           Dsus  D
And made us joint heirs with Your Son

   ————————— Chorus: ———————————————————————————————————————————
    Gsus                   Am7
How high and how wide, how deep and how long,
    F             C/E            Dsus  D
How sweet and how strong is Your love;
    Gsus                   Am7
How lavish Your grace, how faithful Your ways,

   How great is Your love, O Lord

   ————————— Verse 2: ——————————————————————————————————————————
G                     Am7
Objects of mercy, who should have known wrath,
      G/B                     CaddA  Dsus  D
We're filled with unspeakable joy,
G                  Am7
Riches of wisdom unsearchable wealth,
        G/B                    Dsus   D
And the wonder of knowing Your voice;
F                        A/E         A
You are our treasure and our great reward,
    Am7                   Dsus  D
Our hope and our glorious King
