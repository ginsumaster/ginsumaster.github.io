   ————————— Verse 1: ——————————————————————————————————————————
D               A              Bm
  Many men will drink the rain
                      G
And turn to thank the clouds
D             A
Many men will hear You speak
          Bm          G
They will never turn around

   ————————— Bridge: ———————————————————————————————————————————
D                       A                 Bm
  But I will not forget You are my God my King
                        G                 D
With a thankful heart I bring an offering
                    A                     Bm
And my sacrifice is not what You can give
                     G
But what I alone can give to You

   ————————— Chorus: ———————————————————————————————————————————
D                          A                          Bm
  A grateful heart I give.   A thankful prayer I pray
               G                 D
A wild dance I dance before You.
                    A                    Bm
A loud song I sing.   A huge bell I ring
                   G
A life of praise I live before You

   ————————— Verse 2: ——————————————————————————————————————————
D               A               Bm
  Many men will pour their gold
                       G
And serve a thing that shines
D             A
Many men will read Your words
          Bm                 G
They will never change their minds
