   ————————— Verse 1: ——————————————————————————————————————————
  C                C2/B
Before the day,  before the light
  Am                                 F   G
Before the world revolved around the sun
C                         C2/B
God on high  stepped down into time
              Am                         F   G
And wrote the story of His love for everyone

   ————————— Pre-Chorus: ———————————————————————————————————————
F                   G                   F             C/G     F
  He has filled our hearts with wonder,   so that we always remember

   ————————— Chorus: ———————————————————————————————————————————
C                               F
You and I are made to worship.  You and I are called to love
Dm7                        G7
You and I are forgiven and free
     C                                 F
When you and I embrace surrender; when you and I choose to believe then
Dm7            G7                        1,2,E: C  B: Dm7
You and I will see  who we were meant to        be

C               C2/B
All we are  and all we have
   Am                            F     G
Is all a gift from God that we receive
C                        C2/B
Brought to life  we open up our eyes
           Am                       F    G
To see the majesty and glory of the King

   ————————— Bridge: ———————————————————————————————————————————
Dm7                    C/E                   F
    Even the rocks cry out. Even the heavens shout
                    G7
At the sound of His Holy name.
Dm7                         C/E                     F
    So let ev'ry voice sing out. Let ev'ry knee bow down
               G7
He's worthy of all our praise
