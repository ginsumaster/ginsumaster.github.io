   ————————— Verse 1: ——————————————————————————————————————————
          G              C
O Lord my God, when I in awesome wonder
         G        D7                    G
Consider all, the worlds Thy hands have made
          G                 C
I see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder
                 G        D7          G
Thy pow'r throughout, the universe displayed

   ————————— Chorus: ———————————————————————————————————————————
D               G        C             G
  Then sings my soul, my Savior God to Thee
Em                Am       C/D        GM7
   How great Thou art, how great Thou art
D               G        C             G
  Then sings my soul, my Savior God to Thee
Em                Am   D7                G
   How great Thou art,    how great Thou art

   ————————— Verse 2: ——————————————————————————————————————————
              G                 C
When thru the woods, and forest glades I wander
             G           D7             G
And hear the birds, sing sweetly in the trees
            G                C
When I look down, from lofty mountain grandeur
             G          D7              G
And hear the brook, and feel the gentle breeze

   ————————— Verse 3: ——————————————————————————————————————————
           G                   C
And when I think, that God His Son not sparing
            G      D7                 G
Sent Him to die, I scarce can take it in
            G                C
That on the cross, my burden gladly bearing
            G        D7           G
He bled and died, to take away my sin

   ————————— Verse 4: ——————————————————————————————————————————
                  G                   C
When Christ shall come, with shout of acclamation
            G          D7                G
And take me home, what joy shall fill my heart
             G              C
Then I shall bow, in humble adoration
             G         D7                 G
And there proclaim, my God how great Thou art
