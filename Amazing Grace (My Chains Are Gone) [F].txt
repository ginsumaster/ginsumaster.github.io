Amazing grace how sweet the sound

Was blind but now I see

And grace my fears relieved

How precious did that grace appear

The hour I first believed

As long as life endures

The earth shall soon dissolve like snow
                   C/F
The sun forbear to shine
    F                 Bb     F
But God who called me here below
           C/F  F
Will be forever mine
           C/F  F
Will be forever mine
           C/F  F
You are forever mine
