 <p>How sweet to hold, a newborn baby</p><br>
<h6>             G                 D</h6><br>
 <p>And feel the pride, and joy he gives</p><br>
<h6>            G                 C</h6><br>
 <p>But greater still, the calm assurance</p><br>

 <p>I'll fight life's final, war with pain</p><br>
<h6>            G                   C</h6><br>
 <p>And then as death, gives way to vict'ry</p><br>
<h6>             G                D                 G</h6><br>
 <p>I'll see the lights, of glory and I'll know, He reigns</p><br>
