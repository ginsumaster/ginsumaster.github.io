Break through,  break through all my doubts
Break through,  break through all my fears
Break through  that I may worship You
Break through,  break through all my pain
Break through,  all my guilt and my shame
Break through  like only You can do

You are brighter than my darkest night
Stronger than my toughest fight
Just one touch from You, my King, my Friend
And I'll nev-er be the same again
Break through,  break through
Break through,  break through
