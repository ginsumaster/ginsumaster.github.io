   ————————— Verse 1: ——————————————————————————————————————————
            D
I can only imagine, what it will be like,
       G
When I walk, by Your side
            D
I can only imagine, what my eyes will see,
          G
When Your face is before me
            D
I can only imagine

   ————————— Chorus: ———————————————————————————————————————————
   G2                          A
Surrounded by Your glory, what will my heart feel?
       D2            D            D2            D
Will I dance for You Jesus, or in awe of You be still?
       G2                              A
Will I stand in Your presence or to my knees will I fall?
       D2        D                D2               D
Will I sing hallelujah? Will I be able to speak at all?
            G2      A             D
I can only imagine,   I can only imagine

   ————————— Verse 2: ——————————————————————————————————————————
            D
I can only imagine, when that day comes
      G
And I find myself, standing in the Son
            D
I can only imagine, when all I will do,
      G
Is forever, forever worship You
            D      G
I can only imagine
            D
I can only imagine
