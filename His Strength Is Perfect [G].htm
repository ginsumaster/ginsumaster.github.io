<h3><sup><big>    ————————— Verse 1: ————————————————————————————————————————————————</big></sup></h3>
<h6>G        Am6  D               G/B        Am/C     G</h6><br>
 <p>I can do all  things, through Christ who gives me strength</p><br>
<h6>        C       G/B         Am     D/F#       G</h6><br>
 <p>But sometimes I wonder what He can do through me</p><br>
<h6>   G        Am6     D     /C    G/B   Am/C  Em7</h6><br>
 <p>No great success to show,    no glory on my own</p><br>
<h6>          C        G/B   Am              Am  D</h6><br>
 <p>Yet in my weakness He is there to let me know</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    ————————— Chorus: —————————————————————————————————————————————————</big></sup></h3>
<h6>G   Am       G/B  CM7           D/F#            G    (C/G  G</h6><br>
 <p>His strength is   perfect, when our strength is gone ]</p><br>
<h6>G             CM7        D/F#        Dm</h6><br>
 <p>  He'll carry us when we can't carry on</p><br>
<h6>E7               AmaddB    D/F#  BaddC/D#  Em  /D</h6><br>
 <p>   Raised in His power the weak  become    strong</p><br>
<h6>A/C#                 AmaddB</h6><br>
 <p>     His strength is perfect</p><br>

 <p>     His strength is perfect</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    ————————— Verse 2: ————————————————————————————————————————————————</big></sup></h3>
<h6>G      Am6  D         G/B   Am/C    G</h6><br>
 <p>We can only know, the power that He holds</p><br>
<h6>        C     G/B     Am       D/F#     G</h6><br>
 <p>When we truly see how deep our weakness goes</p><br>
<h6>    G           Am6  D     /C      G/B        Am/C  Em7</h6><br>
 <p>His strength in us begins,    when ours comes to an end</p><br>
<h6>   C         G/B    Am               Am  D</h6><br>
 <p>He hears our humble cry, and proves again</p><br>
