<h3><sup><big>    â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Chorus: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”</big></sup></h3>
<p>If You say go we will go   If You say wait we will wait</p><br>
<p>If You say step out on the water and they say it can't be done</p><br>
<p>We'll fix our eyes on You and we will come</p><br>
<br>
<p>Your ways are higher than our ways</p><br>
<p>And the plans that You have laid are good and true</p><br>
<p>If You call us to the fire, You will not withdraw Your hand</p><br>
<p>We'll gaze into the flames and look for You</p><br>
