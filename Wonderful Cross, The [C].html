<p>When I survey the wondrous Cross</p><br>
<p>On which the Prince of Glory died</p><br>
<p>My richest gain, I count but loss</p><br>
<p>And pour contempt on all my pride</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Verse 2: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”</big></sup></h3>
<p>See from His head, His hands, His feet</p><br>
<p>Sorrow and love flow mingled down</p><br>
<p>Did ever such love and sorrow meet?</p><br>
<p>Or thorns compose, so rich a crown</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Chorus: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”</big></sup></h3>
<p>Oh the wonderful cross, oh the wonderful cross</p><br>
<p>Bids me come and die and find that I may truly live</p><br>
<p>Oh the wonderful cross, oh the wonderful cross</p><br>
<p>All who gather here by grace, draw near and bless Your name</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Verse 3: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”</big></sup></h3>
<p>Were the whole realm of nature mine</p><br>
<p>That were an offering far too small</p><br>
<p>Love so amazing, so divine</p><br>
<p>Demands my soul, my life, my all</p><br>
