Be now my vision, Creator of all
Spirit of Heaven You hear when I call
I praise You always, sinc You're by my side,
Waking or sleeping, Your Spirit inside

â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Verse 2: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”
Be Thou my wisdon, my help and my guide
I yearn for love only You can provide
I'm Your creation, like Father and child
Arms of pure love, always undefiled

Money I seek not nor vain empty fame
You're my inheritance, I can now claim
Reign in my heart, let joy fill my soul
Mold me and shape me, 'til I become whole

â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Verse 4: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”
Great God in Glory, the victory won
Heaven rejoices with new life begun
Forgiveness and freedom, for all who will call
Stil be my vision, Creator of all
