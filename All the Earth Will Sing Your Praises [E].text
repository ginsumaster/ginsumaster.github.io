You took.  You take our sins away O God
You give.  You gave Your life away for us
You came down.  You saved us through the cross
Our hearts are changed, because of Your great love

You lived  You died
You said in three days You would rise
You did  You're alive
You rule  You reign
You said You're coming back again
I know  (that) You will
And all the earth will sing Your praises
All the earth will sing Your praises
