Em                           C                            G
   This dry and desert land,   I tell myself keep walking on
Em                            C                      G
   Here's something up ahead,   water falling like a song
Em                        C                       G
   An everlasting stream,   Your river carries me home,
G
  Let it flow, let it flow

Em                      C                            G
   A flood for my soul,   a well that never will run dry
Em                         C                         G
   I've rambled on my own,   never believing I would find
Em                        C                       G
   An everlasting stream,   Your river carries me home,
       C
Let it flow, let it flow

Open the heavens, come  living water, all my fountains  are in You
G                    G
Strong like a river, Your love  is running through,

   All my fountains  are in You

Come on and rain down on us, rain down on us Lord
