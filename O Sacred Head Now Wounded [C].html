<h3><sup><big>    â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Verse 1: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”</big></sup></h3>
<p>O sacred Head now wounded, with grief and shame weighed down</p><br>
<p>Now scornfully surrounded, with thorns Thine only crown</p><br>
<p>How pale Thou art with anguish, with sore abuse and scorn</p><br>
<p>How does that visage languish which once was bright as morn!</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Verse 2: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”</big></sup></h3>
<p>What Thou my Lord hast suffered was all for sinners' gain</p><br>
<p>All mine was the transgression, but Thine the deadly pain</p><br>
<p>Lo here I fall, my Savior, 'tis I deserve Thy place</p><br>
<p>Look on me with Thy favor; assist me with Thy grace</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Verse 3: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”</big></sup></h3>
<p>What language shall I bor row to thank Thee dearest Friend,</p><br>
<p>For this Thy dying sorrow, Thy pity without end?</p><br>
<p>O make me Thine forever, and should I fainting be,</p><br>
<p>Lord let me never, never outlive my love for Thee</p><br>
