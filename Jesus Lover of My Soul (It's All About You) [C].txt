   ————————— Chorus: ———————————————————————————————————————————
               Am  F  C  G                    Am  F
It's all about You    Je-sus, and all this is for You
         C              G
For Your glory and Your fame
               Am  F       C                    F
It's not about me,-  as if You should do things my way
Am            Gsus     G           F         C    F  Em  G
You alone are God, and I surrender,  to Your ways

C  F    Gsus   G      C     F             C          Gsus  G
Je-sus, I want You to know, I will follow You all my days
    Am             F          Am   F
For no one else in history is like You
    C         G               Fsus  F
And history itself belongs to You
Am         F              Am    F

    C             F            G   Gsus  G
And I will spend eternity with You
