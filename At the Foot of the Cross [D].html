<p>At the foot of the cross, where I kneel in adoration</p><br>
<p> And I lay my burdens down.</p><br>
<p>I exchange all my sin for the promise of salvation</p><br>
<p> And Your name across my brow</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Verse 2: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”</big></sup></h3>
<p>At the foot of the cross, I give up my vain ambition</p><br>
<p> And I leave my selfish pride</p><br>
<p>In the peace that is there, will You restore my vision</p><br>
<p> In all the places I am blind</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Chorus: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”</big></sup></h3>

<p>At the foot of the cross, there is healing for this nation</p><br>
<p> There is rest for those who wait</p><br>
<p>And the love that we find, is the hope of all creation</p><br>
<p> We are stunned by what You gave</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Verse 4: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”</big></sup></h3>
<p>We will wait at the cross, a hungry generation</p><br>
<p> With our broken hearts and lives</p><br>
<p>Will You hear will You come. Will You fill our desperation</p><br>
<p> O God let this be the time</p><br>
