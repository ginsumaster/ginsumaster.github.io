And haunts me with each hearing, of His softly spoken words

My conscience a reminder, of forgiveness that I need

Who is this King of glory,   who offers it to me

Revealing things of heaven, and all its mysteries

My spirit's ever longing for His grace in which to stand
    A                      G                       D
Who is this King of glory,   Son of God and Son of Man

And wisdom beyond measure, the gracious King of kings

The Lord of earth and heaven, the Creator of all things
   A                     G                    D
He is the King of glory.   He's ev'rything to me
