C                     F    G7            C
  We're the people of God, called by His name
Am              Dm          G            C
Called from the dark, and delivered from shame
         F     G           C
One Holy race, saints ev'ryone
  Am           Dm    C/E  F6      G         C
Because of the blood of   Christ, Jesus the Son

C                        F   C
We no longer live in the darkness
       Em         Am7          G
In the kingdom of light we now stand
C                          F            C
We are His servants, we're purchased by scars
C             Am7          F6        G            C
Bought by the blood of the Lamb, the blood of the Lamb

         C                       F  C
With our lips let us sing one confession
         Em             Am7        G
With our hearts hold to one truth alone
    C                      F   C
For He has erased our transgressions
C              Am7           F6   G        C
Claimed us and called us His own, His very own

C                     F   C
Hear us, O spirits of darkness
   Em       Am7           G
So you will know where we stand
C                  F              C
We are His people, purchased with scars
C             Am7          F6        G            C
Bought by the blood of the Lamb, the blood of the Lamb
