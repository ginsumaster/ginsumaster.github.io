   ————————— Verse 1: ——————————————————————————————————————————
C                Dm7(4)  Am7                    F2
  I've carried a burden      for too long on my own
C             Dm7(4)   Am7      F2
  I wasn't created  to bear it alone
C                 Am7(4)  Am7               F2
  I hear Your invitation      to let it all go
         C                  Dm7(4)       Am7     Am(4)  F2
I see it now  I'm laying it down  I know that I  need   You

   ————————— Chorus: ———————————————————————————————————————————
             C                   Dm7(4)                   Am7                  F2
I run to the Father  I fall into grace  I'm done with the hiding  no reason to wait
                        C                               Dm7(4)
My heart needs(found) a surgeon  my soul needs(found) a friend
                   Am7               F2                  C
So I'll run to the Father again and again and again and again

   ————————— Verse 2: ——————————————————————————————————————————
C               Dm7(4)  Am7                     F2
  You saw my condition      had a plan from the start
C                Dm7(4)   Am7                  F2
  Your Son for redemption     the price for my heart
C                Dm7(4)  Am7                  F2
  I don't have a context     for that kind of love
             C                    Dm7(4)              Am7  G(4)  F2
I don't understand  I can't comprehend  all I know is I    need  You

My heart has been in  Your  sights  long before my  first  breath
        Am7         F2                  C/E         G
Running into  Your  arms  is running to life  from  death
            Am7              F2                   C/E     G
I feel this rush  deep in my chest  Your mercy is calling out
          Am7             F2           C/E       G
Just as I am  You pull me in  I know I need You  now
