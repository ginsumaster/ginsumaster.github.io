   ————————— Verse 1: ——————————————————————————————————————————
C              Am        F            G
You said You'd come, and share all my sorrows
C              Am        F            G
You said You'd be there, for all my tomorrows
C         G        F            G
I came so close to sending You away
    C             Am            F             G
But just like You promised, You came there to stay
  G7          C
I just had to pray

   ————————— Chorus: ———————————————————————————————————————————
    C7           F                  C
And Jesus said, "Come to the water, stand by My side
  G                         G7       C
I know you are thirsty, you won't be denied
  C7         F                              C
I felt ev'ry teardrop, when in darkness you cried,
                  G                  G7            C     (F  C)
And I strove to remind you, that for those tears I died"

   ————————— Verse 2: ——————————————————————————————————————————
     C           Am       F          G
Your goodness so great, I can't understand
    C            Am        F            G
And dear Lord, I know that this was all planned
C             G             F           G
I know You're here now, and always will be
     C              Am         F          G
Your love loosed my chains and in You I'm free
    G7        C
But Jesus why me

   ————————— Verse 3: ——————————————————————————————————————————
C       Am          F            G
Jesus I give You my heart and my soul
  C             Am          F        G
I know that without God I'd never be whole,
C            G      F             G
Saviour, You opened all the right doors,
      C             Am              F              G
And I thank You and praise You from earth's humble shores
G7           C
Take me, I'm Yours
