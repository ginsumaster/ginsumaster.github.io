<h3><sup><big>    â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Verse 1: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”</big></sup></h3>
<p> When all I see is the battle,  You see my victory</p><br>
<p> When all I see is the mountain,  You see a moun-tain moved</p><br>
<p> And as I walk through the shadow, Your love surrounds me</p><br>
<p> There's nothing to fear now  for I am safe with You</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Chorus 1: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”</big></sup></h3>
<p>So when I fight, I'll fight on my knees, with my hands lifted high</p><br>
<p>Oh God, the battle belongs to You</p><br>
<p>And every fear I lay at Your feet, I'll sing through the night</p><br>
<p>Oh God, the battle belongs to You</p><br>
<br>

<p> And if You are for me, who can be against me</p><br>
<p> For Jesus, there's nothing impossible for You</p><br>
<p> When all I see are the ashes, You see the beauty</p><br>
<p> When all I see is a cross, God You see the emp-ty tomb</p><br>
<br>

<p> Almighty Fort-ress, You go be-fore us</p><br>
<p>Nothing can stand against the power of our God</p><br>
<p>You shine in the sha-dows, You win every battle</p><br>
<p>Nothing can stand against the power of our God</p><br>
