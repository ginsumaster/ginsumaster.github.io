Je-sus, that name by which we have been saved
Je-sus, what joy and peace, just the sound of it brings
That name high above all names

â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Verse 1: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”
No other name can make the darkness flee
No other name can our salvation bring
No other name can set the sinner free
Only Jesus Christ the King
