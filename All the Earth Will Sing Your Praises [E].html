<p> You took.  You take our sins away O God</p><br>
<p> You give.  You gave Your life away for us</p><br>
<p> You came down.  You saved us through the cross</p><br>
<p> Our hearts are changed, because of Your great love</p><br>

<p> You lived  You died</p><br>

<p> You said You're coming back again</p><br>
<p>I know  (that) You will</p><br>
<p>And all the earth will sing Your praises</p><br>
<p>All the earth will sing Your praises</p><br>
