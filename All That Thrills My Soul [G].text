Who can cheer a heart like Jesus, by His presence all divine
True and tender, pure and precious, O, how blest to call Him mine

And the fairest of ten thousand
In my blessed Lord I see

On His strength divine relying, He is all in all to me

By the crystal flowing river, with the ransomed I will sing
And forever and forever, praise and glorify the King
