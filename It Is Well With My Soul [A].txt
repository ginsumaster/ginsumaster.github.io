     A             A/E      E7/B       A
When peace, like a river, attendeth my way,

When sorrows like sea    billows roll;

Whatever my lot, Thou has taught me to say,
      A/C#        A/E   E7      A
It is well, it is well, with my soul.

Though Satan should buffet, though trials should come,

Let this blest assur-   ance control,
     A            D         Bm         E
That Christ has regarded my helpless estate,

And hath shed His own blood for my soul.

My sin, oh, the bliss of this glorious thought!
   F#m         F#m/A  E/B     E      E7
My sin, not in part   but the whole,
   A             D            Bm         E
Is nailed to the cross, and I bear it no more,
           A/C#             A/E   E7   A
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul!

For me, be it Christ, be it Christ hence to live,
   F#m     F#m/A  E/B      E     E7
If Jordan above   me shall roll,

No pang shall be mine, for in death as in life
          A/C#        A/E   E7    A
Thou wilt whisper Thy peace to my soul.

But, Lord, tis for Thee, for Thy coming we wait,
    F#m          F#m/A  E/B    E     E7
The sky, not the grave, is our goal;
   A            D         Bm           E
Oh trump of the angel! Oh voice of the Lord!

Blessed hope, blessed rest of my soul!

And Lord, haste the day when my faith shall be sight,
    F#m              F#m/A  E/B  E       E7
The clouds be rolled back   as a scroll;
    A             D              Bm           E
The trump shall resound, and the Lord shall descend,
     A/C#      A/E  E7      A
Even so, it is well with my soul.
