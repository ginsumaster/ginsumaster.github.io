  G                 Am/G  G   G/B   Am/C  C              C/G  G
I heard an old  old sto-  ry  how a Sav-  ior came  from glo- ry
       Em            D  G  B7/F#  Em  G/B  A             A9   D
How He gave His life on Calva-    ry  to   save a wretch like me
  G                Am/G  G    G/B    Am/C  C             C/E  C/G  G
I heard about  His groan-ing  of His pre-  cious blood's a-   ton- ing
     Em      D  G  B7/F#  Em   G7/B  Am/C    G/D  D7  G
Then I repented of my     sins and   won the vic- to- ry

  G           G      G7  Am/C  C    C/E  C/G  G
O victory  in Jesus  my  Sav-  ior  for- ev-  er
   Em         D   G               A9            D
He sought me  and bought me  with His redeeming blood
G                C/G  G         G7  Am/C  C        C/E  C/G  G
He loved me ere  I    knew Him  and all   my love  is   due  Him
                                   Am/C  G/D   D7  G
He plunged me  to victory  beneath the   cleansing flood

I heard about  His heal- ing  of His cleansing pow'r re-  veal-ing
       Em            D  G    B7/F#  Em   G/B  A                A9  D
How He made the lame to walk a-     gain and  caused the blind to  see
    G                 Am/G  G   G/B      Am/C  C     C/E  C/G  G
And then I cried dear Je-   sus come and heal  my broken  spir-it
    Em        D        B7/F#  Em      G7/B  Am/C   G/D  D7  G
And somehow Jesus came and    brought to    me the vic- to- ry

  G             Am/G  G    G/B    Am/C  C      C/E  C/G  G
I heard about a man-  sion He has built for me in   glo- ry
     Em             D   G       B7/F#  Em   G/B  A            A9  D
And I   heard about the streets of     gold be-  yond the crystal sea
 G               Am/G  G   G/B     Am/C  C   C/E  C/G  G
About the angels sing- ing and the old redemption sto- ry
    Em             D    G    B7/F#  Em    G7/B  Am/C  C  G/D  D7  G
And some sweet day I'll sing up     there the   song  of vic- to- ry
