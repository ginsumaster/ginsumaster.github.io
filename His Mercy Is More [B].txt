   ————————— Verse 1: ——————————————————————————————————————————
     B            B/D#       E              B
What love could remember, no wrongs we have done
  F#            G#m         E                F#sus
Omniscient, all-knowing, He counts not their sum
       B      C#m7        B/D#      E
Thrown into a sea without bottom or shore
B/D#  E             B/F#      F#sus  F#6  F#sus  B
Our   sins they are many, His mer-   cy   is     more

   ————————— Verse 2: ——————————————————————————————————————————
     B              B/D#       E          B
What patience would wait as we constantly roam
     F#        G#m       E          F#sus
What Father so tender is calling us home
   B            C#m7         B/D#        E
He welcomes the weakest, the vilest, the poor
B/D#  E             B/F#      F#sus  F#6  F#sus  B
Our   sins they are many, His mer-   cy   is     more

   ————————— Verse 3: ——————————————————————————————————————————
     B         B/D#        E           B
What riches of kindness He lavished on us
    F#            G#m         E            F#sus
His blood was the payment His life was the cost
   B              C#m7          B/D#    E
We stood 'neath a debt we could never afford
B/D#  E             B/F#      F#sus  F#6   B
Our   sins they are many, His mer-   cy is more
