Is anyone worthy? Is anyone whole?
Is anyone able to break the seal and open the scroll?
The Lion of Judah who conquered the grave
He is David's Root and the Lamb who died to ransom the slave
Is He blessing and honor and glory?
Is He worthy of this?
He is

Forever those He loves?  He does
Does our God intend to dwell again with us?
