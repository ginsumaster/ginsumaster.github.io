<h3><sup><big>    ————————— Verse 1: ————————————————————————————————————————————————</big></sup></h3>
<h6>D</h6><br>
 <p>  I can't count the times I've called Your name some broken night</p><br>
 <p>And You showed up and patched me up like You do every time</p><br>
 <p>I get amnesia,  I forget that You keep coming around</p><br>
 <p>Yeah, ain't no way You'll ever let me down</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    ————————— Chorus: —————————————————————————————————————————————————</big></sup></h3>
<h6>           D                      Em7</h6><br>
 <p>Good God Almighty,  I hope You'll find me</p><br>
<h6>G                                 D</h6><br>
 <p>Praising Your Name no matter what comes</p><br>
<h6>                    D                   Em7</h6><br>
 <p>'Cause I know where I'd be without Your mercy</p><br>
<h6>          G                                   D</h6><br>
 <p>So I keep praising Your name at the top of my lungs</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    ————————— Post Chorus: ————————————————————————————————————————————</big></sup></h3>
<h6>              D                               Em7</h6><br>
 <p>Tell me is He good (He's good)  Tell me is He God (He's God)</p><br>
<h6>      G            D</h6><br>
 <p>He is   Good God Almighty</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    ————————— Verse 2: ————————————————————————————————————————————————</big></sup></h3>
<h6>D</h6><br>
 <p>  You say Your love goes on forever that Your mercy never stops</p><br>
 <p>So why would I assume You'd be somebody that You're not</p><br>
 <p>Like sun in the morning,  I know You're gonna be there every day</p><br>
 <p>So what on earth could make me be afraid</p><br>
<br>
