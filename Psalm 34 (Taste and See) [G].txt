             G                    C        G
I sought the Lord          and He answered me
              D          C            G
And delivered me           from every fear
                  G            C   G
Those who look on Him      are radiant
                  D      C                   G
They'll never be ashamed   they'll never be ashamed

The Son of God         surrounds His saints

He will deliver them   He will deliver them
