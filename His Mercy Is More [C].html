<p>What love could remember, no wrongs we have done</p><br>
<p>Omniscient, all-knowing, He counts not their sum</p><br>
<p>Thrown into a sea without bottom or shore</p><br>
<p>Our sins they are many, His mercy is more</p><br>

<p>What patience would wait as we constantly roam</p><br>

<p>What riches of kindness He lavished on us</p><br>
<p>His blood was the payment His life was the cost</p><br>
<p>We stood 'neath a debt we could never afford</p><br>
<p>Our sins they are many, His mercy is more</p><br>
