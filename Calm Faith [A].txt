  E                                       A
A prayer from the inner heart we bring to You
    F#m                              B
For deep unspoken cries are breaking through
    E           B             F#m
For You love us like no other can
    E           B             A
And You know us like no other can

                 E    B
We're asking for calm faith
                 F#m     E
We're asking for burning love
                        F#m
We're asking for bright hope
      B7                  E     C: A
And a deep compassion for souls

And 'til the end of time Your love remains
    E           B             F#m
For You love us like no other can
    E           B             A
And You know us like no other can
