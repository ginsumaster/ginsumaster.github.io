Oh  to see  the dawn  of  the dark-est day  Christ on a road to Calvary.
Tried  by sin-ful men  torn and beat-en then  nailed to a cross of wood

Oh  to see  the pain  writ-ten on  Your face  bearing the awesome weight of sin.
Eve-ry bit-ter thought  and ev'ry e-vil deed  crowning Your blood-stained brow.

â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Chorus 1: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”

Now  the day-light flees  now the ground  beneath  quakes as its Maker bows His head
Cur-tain torn  in two  dead are raised  to life  finished the vict'ry cry.

â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Verse 4: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”
Oh  to see  my name  writ-ten in the wounds  for through Your suff'ring I am free.
Death  is crushed  to death  life  is mine  to live  won through Your selfless love.
