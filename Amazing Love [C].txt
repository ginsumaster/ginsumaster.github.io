   ————————— Verse 1: ——————————————————————————————————————————
G/B    Am         Dm7                Gsus  G    F/C  C
    My Lord, what love is this, that pays    so dear-ly
G/B      Am     Dm7        F   G  Csus  C
    That I, the guilty one may go free

   ————————— Chorus: ———————————————————————————————————————————
 Gm7          F      C/E
Amazing love, O what sacrifice
    Eb          F         G
The Son of God, giv'n for me
   Gm7          F      C/E           /C
My debt He pays and my death He dies
     Gm7  F       C          Gm7  F       C
That I      might live, that I      might live

G/B     Am       Dm7                Gsus    G   F/C  C
    And so, they watched Him die, despised,   rejec- ted
G/B     Am      Dm7            F      G   Csus  C
    But oh, the blood He shed, flowed for me

G/B     Am        Dm7                   Gsus  G      F/C  C
    And now, this love of Christ, shall flow    like ri-  vers
F    G   Am        Dm7         F    G  Csus  C
Come and wash your guilt away, live a- gain!
