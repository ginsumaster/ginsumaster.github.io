<p>How great the chasm  that lay between us  How high the mountain  I could not climb</p><br>
<p>In desperation,  I turned to heaven  And spoke Your name  into  the night</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Verse 2: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”</big></sup></h3>
<p>Then through the darkness,  Your lovingkindness  Tore through the shadows of my soul</p><br>
<p>The work is finished,  the end is written  Jesus Christ,  my living hope</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Verse 3: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”</big></sup></h3>
<p>Who could imagine  so great a mercy  What heart could fathom  such boundless grace</p><br>
<p>The God of ages,  stepped down from glory  To wear my sin  and bear my shame</p><br>
<br>
<p>The cross has spoken,  I am forgiven  The King of kings calls me His own</p><br>
<p>Beautiful Savior,  I'm Yours forever  Jesus Christ,  my living hope</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Chorus: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”</big></sup></h3>
<p>Hallelujah,  praise the One who set me free</p><br>
<p>Hallelujah,  death has lost its grip on me</p><br>
<p>You have broken every chain,  there's salvation in Your name</p><br>
<p>Jesus Christ,  my living hope</p><br>
<br>

<p>Then came the morning  that sealed the promise  Your buried body  began to breathe</p><br>
<p>Out of the silence,  the roaring Lion  Declared the grave has no claim on me</p><br>
<p>Jesus, Yours is the victory</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Outro: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”</big></sup></h3>
