     A               D            F#m        E
I am pressed but not crushed persecuted not abandoned
A        D              F#m     E
  Struck down but not destroyed
     A                  D             F#m            E
I am blessed beyond the curse for His promise will endure
         A           D     F#m      E
That His joy's gonna be my strength
E                       Esus         E
  Though the sorrow may last for the night
    G                      D
His joy comes with the morning
