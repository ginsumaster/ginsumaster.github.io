   ————————— Chorus: ———————————————————————————————————————————
G               D/F#
God will make a way
            C/E            G/D
Where there seems to be no way,
   C                G/B
He works in ways we cannot see,
Am             CM7     D
He will make a way for me;
G             D/F#
He will be my guide,
        C/E            G/D
Hold me closely to His side,
T:      C                     G/B
   With love and strength for each new day,
Am  Bm   C    D  Em   Am           D  G   G/F
He  will make a  way, He will make a  way

   ————————— Verse 1: ——————————————————————————————————————————
     Eb             F/Eb             Bbsus   Bb
By a roadway in the wilderness He'll lead me
    Eb            F             G    G/B
And rivers in the desert will I see;
C                     D/C
Heaven and earth will fade
        Bm7       B7/D#   Em
But His Word will still remain,
Am         D               Esus  E  D
He will do something new today
