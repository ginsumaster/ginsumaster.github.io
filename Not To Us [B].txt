   ————————— Verse 1: ——————————————————————————————————————————
B                                 G#m7
  The cross before me the world behind
                                 B2/F#
No turning back raise the banner high
             E               B
It's not for me It's all for You
B                                     G#m7
  Let the heavens shake and split the sky
                                    B2/F#
Let the people clap their hands and cry
             E               B
It's not for me It's all for You

   ————————— Chorus: ———————————————————————————————————————————
B                       Asus        A
Not to use, but to Your name be the glory (x2)

   ————————— Verse 2: ——————————————————————————————————————————
B                               G#m7
  Our hearts unfold before Your throne
                             B2/F#
The only place for those who know
             E               B
It's not for me It's all for You
B                             G#m7
  Send Your holy fire on this offering
                                      B2/F#
Let our worship burn for the world to see
             E               B
It's not for me It's all for You

    B                                         E
The earth is shaking, the mountains shouting.   It's all for You
    G#m                     F#             E
The waves are crashing, the sun is raging.   It's all for You
    B                              E
The universe spinning and singing.   It's all for You
     G#m              F#               E                  B
Your children dancing dancing dancing.   It's all for You
