<h3><sup><big>    â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Verse 1: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”</big></sup></h3>
<p>You said You'd come, and share all my sorrows</p><br>
<p>You said You'd be there, for all my tomorrows</p><br>
<p>I came so close to sending You away</p><br>
<p>But just like You promised, You came there to stay</p><br>
<p>I just had to pray</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Chorus: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”</big></sup></h3>
<p>And Jesus said, "Come to the water, stand by My side</p><br>
<p>I know you are thirsty, you won't be denied</p><br>
<p>I felt ev'ry teardrop, when in darkness you cried,</p><br>
<p>And I strove to remind you, that for those tears I died"</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Verse 2: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”</big></sup></h3>
<p>Your goodness so great, I can't understand</p><br>
<p>And dear Lord, I know that this was all planned</p><br>
<p>I know You're here now, and always will be</p><br>
<p>Your love loosed my chains and in You I'm free</p><br>
<p>But Jesus why me</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Verse 3: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”</big></sup></h3>
<p>Jesus I give You my heart and my soul</p><br>
<p>I know that without God I'd never be whole,</p><br>
<p>Saviour, You opened all the right doors,</p><br>
<p>And I thank You and praise You from earth's humble shores</p><br>
<p>Take me, I'm Yours</p><br>
