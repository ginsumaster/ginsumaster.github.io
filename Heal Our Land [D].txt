Forgive oh Lord, and heal our land
    G       D/F#    Em        D         Em             A
And give us eyes to seek Your face, and hearts to understand

That You alone make all things new
        G         D/F#   Em      D        Em     A6         D
And the blessings of the land we love are really gifts from You

D  A  G  D/F#     G      A
If My people will humbly pray
    G       D/F#     Em    D        Em               A
And seek My face and turn away from all their wicked ways
     D    A  G    D/F#     G       A
Then will I  hear them and move my hand
    G      D/F#      Em   D        Em     A6         D
And freely then will I forgive and I will heal their land

Unite our hearts in one accord
    G       D/F#   Em       D         Em               A
And make us hungry for Your peace and burdened for the poor
             D                  F#m
And grant us hope that we might see
    G      D/F#    Em      D        Em       A6    D
The future for the land we love our life our lib-erty
