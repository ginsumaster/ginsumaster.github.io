   ————————— Chorus: ———————————————————————————————————————————
   G        D    C             G
My eyes are dry,   my faith is old
Am             Em    D            Em  D    Em7  D/F#
   My heart is hard,   my prayers are cold
    G      D   C            G
And I know how   I ought to be
Am          Em   D             G  C/G  G
   Alive to You,   and dead to me

   ————————— Verse 1: ——————————————————————————————————————————
    G    Am7  G/B  C                Bm    Am   G
But what can  be   done, for an old heart like mine
    G  C/G  G  D      D       G
Soften it   up   with oil and wine
    G   Am  G/B  C            Bm  Am  G
The oil     is   You, the Spirit  of  love
       G    C/G  G  D           Em7/D   D/F#  G
Please wash me   a- new, in the wine of Your  blood
