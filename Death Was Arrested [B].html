<p>Alone in my sorrow, and dead in my sin</p><br>
<p>Lost without hope, with no place to begin</p><br>
<p>Your love made a way to let mercy come in</p><br>
<p>When death was arrested, and my life began</p><br>
<br>

<p>Ash was redeemed, only beauty remains</p><br>
<p>My orphan heart was given a name</p><br>
<p>My mourning grew quiet, my feet rose to dance</p><br>
<p>When death was arrested, and my life began</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Chorus: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”</big></sup></h3>
<p>Oh your grace  so free,  washes over me</p><br>
<p>You have made me new, now life begins with You</p><br>

<p>Released from my chains, I'm a prisoner no more</p><br>

<p>He cancelled my debt, and He called me His friend</p><br>
<p>When death was arrested, and my life began</p><br>
<br>

<p>Our Savior displayed on a criminal's cross</p><br>
<p>Darkness rejoiced, as though heaven had lost</p><br>
<p>But then Jesus arose, with our freedom in hand</p><br>
<p>That's when death was arrested, and my life began</p><br>
<br>

<p>Oh, we free,  free,  forever we're free</p><br>
<p>Come join the song of all the redeemed</p><br>
