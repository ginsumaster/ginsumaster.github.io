I'm gonna be a speaker of truth to all mankind
I'm gonna stand.  I'm gonna run into Your arms
Into Your arms again. Into Your arms
Into Your arms again.

With the fire of God and the truth in hand
We'll see miracles. We'll see angels sing
We'll see broken hearts, making history
Yes it's true and I believe it. I'm living for You
