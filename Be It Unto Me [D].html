<p>Be it unto me, according to Your word</p><br>
<p>According to Your promises, I can stand secure</p><br>
<p>Carve upon my heart, the truth that sets me free</p><br>
<p>According to Your Word O Lord, be it unto me</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Verse 1: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”</big></sup></h3>
<p>You promised Your blood will deliver</p><br>
<p>And Lord we believe it's true</p><br>
<p>You promised us joy like a riv-er</p><br>
<p>And Lord we receive it from You</p><br>
<p>These things You have spoken, and You're bringing to pass</p><br>
<p>This world's disappearing, but Your Word will last</p><br>
<br>

<p>He promised to carry our sorrows</p><br>
<p>Lord we believe it's true</p><br>
<p>You promised unending tomor-rows</p><br>
<p>Lord, we receive them from You</p><br>
<p>You'll be our provider, in Your Word it's revealed</p><br>
<p>And by the stripes You bore Lord, we have been healed</p><br>
