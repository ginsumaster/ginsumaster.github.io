<p>Jesus Christ, I think upon Your sacrifice</p><br>
<p>You became nothing, poured to death</p><br>
<p>Many times, I've wondered at Your gift of life</p><br>
<p>And I'm in that place once again</p><br>
<p>    I'm in that place once again</p><br>
<br>

<p>Once again I look upon the cross where You died</p><br>
<p>I'm humbled by Your mercy and I'm broken inside</p><br>
<p>Once again I thank You, once again I pour out my life</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Verse 2: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”</big></sup></h3>
<p>Now You are exalted to the highest place</p><br>
<p>King of the heavens, where one day I'll bow</p><br>
<p>But for now, I marvel at Your saving grace</p><br>
<p>And I'm full of praise once again</p><br>
<p>    I'm full of praise once again</p><br>
<br>
