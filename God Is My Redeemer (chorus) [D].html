<h3><sup><big>    â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Chorus:  2nd time in () â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”</big></sup></h3>
<p>(Oh) God is my Redeemer</p><br>
<p>And He heals me with reassuring love</p><br>
<p>(And) I love my Redeemer</p><br>
<p> Overwhelming,  overcoming,  redeeming love</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Verse 1: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”</big></sup></h3>
<p>My heart soars like an eagle, in the presence of the Lord</p><br>
<p>As I circle the throne of God, and behold His glory</p><br>
<p>And I behold the living creatures, singing holy holy holy</p><br>
<p>And I see the twenty-four elders, bringing glory to the Lamb</p><br>
<p>And multitudes of angels, rejoicing in His presence</p><br>
<p>And I call it home</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Verse 2: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”</big></sup></h3>
<p>My eyes have never seen anything, like the beauty of the Lord</p><br>
<p>As I lift up my heart, and praise Him I fall down</p><br>
<p>And waves and waves of glory, come and overtake me</p><br>
<p>And I'm immersed in the ocean, of the living love of God</p><br>
<p>And suddenly I'm flooded, with the glory of His presence</p><br>
<p>And I call it home</p><br>
