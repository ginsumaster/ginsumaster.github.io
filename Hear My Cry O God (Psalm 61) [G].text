Hear my cry, O God. Attend unto my prayer
From the ends of the earth, will I cry unto Thee

â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Chorus: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”

Lead me to the Rock, that is higher than I
That is higher than I

And a strong tower  from the enemy

Let me sojourn in Your tent forevermore
Give me refuge in the cover of Your wings
