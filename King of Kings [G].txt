       G/B              C                  D            G
In the darkness we were waiting    without hope without light
          G/B             C                  D             G
Till from heaven You came running  there was mercy in Your eyes

To fulfil the law and prophets     to a virgin came the Word
       G/B               C              D             C
From a throne of endless glory     to a cradle in the dirt

G                  C               Em                Dsus     D
Praise the Father  praise the Son  praise the Spirit three in one
G                  C            T: Em        C           D       G
God of glory       majesty         praise forever to the King of Kings

     G/B              C                D             G
To reveal the kingdom coming    and to reconcile the lost
     G/B               C                D               G
To redeem the whole creation    You did not despise the cross
    G/B          C                      D            G
For even in Your suffering      You saw to the other side
        G/B             C             D                G
Knowing this was our salvation  Jesus for our sake You died

   ————————— Verse 3: ——————————————————————————————————————————
        Em               C                 D               G
And the morning that You rose       all of heaven held its breath
          Em                  C             D                  G
Till that stone was moved for good  for the Lamb had conquered death
        Em                   C              D               G
And the dead rose from their tombs  and the angels stood in awe
        Em                 C               D            G
For the souls of all who'd come     to the Father are restored

        Em                   C              D              G
And the Church of Christ was born  then the Spirit lit the flame
         Em              C                   D               G
Now this gospel truth of old       shall not kneel shall not faint
       Em               C                 D            G
By His blood and in His Name       in His freedom I am free
        Em            C                    D           G
For the love of Jesus Christ       who has resurrected me
