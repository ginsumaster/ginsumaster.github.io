C                            Am           F          C
Grace,  what have You done,  murdered for me on that cross
  C                               Am          C           C
Accused  in absence of wrong,  my sin washed away in Your blood

   ————————— Pre-Chorus 1: —————————————————————————————————————
    Em           F           C       Em             F              C
Too much to make sense of it all,  I know that Your love breaks my fall
    G                      Am                     F
The scandal of grace,  You died in my place so my soul  will  live

   ————————— Chorus: ———————————————————————————————————————————
          C                                   G6

                        F
Jesus, there's no one beside  You

Forever the hope in my heart

C                                  Am          F          C
Death,  where is your sting,  Your power is as dead as my sin
    C                                 Em        C            C
The cross  has taught me to live  and mercy, my heart now to sing

   ————————— Pre-Chorus 2: —————————————————————————————————————
    Em          F              C        Em             F            C
The day and its troubles shall come,  I know that Your strength is enough
    G                      Am                     F
The scandal of grace,  You died in my place so my soul  will  live

         C                                G
And it's all  because of You, Jesus, it's all  because of You, Jesus
     Am                                F
It's all  because of Your love that my soul  will  live
