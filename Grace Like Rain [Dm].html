<h3><sup><big>    ————————— Verse 1: ———————————————————————————————————————————————————</big></sup></h3>
<p>Amazing grace, how sweet the sound</p><br>
<p>That saved a wretch like me</p><br>
<p>I once was lost but now I'm found</p><br>
<p>Was blind but now I see so clearly</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    ————————— Chorus: ————————————————————————————————————————————————————</big></sup></h3>
<p> Hallelujah. Grace like rain falls down on me</p><br>
<p> Hallelujah. All my stains are washed away</p><br>
<p>They're washed away</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    ————————— Verse 2: ———————————————————————————————————————————————————</big></sup></h3>
<p>'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear</p><br>
<p>And grace my fears relieved</p><br>
<p>How precious did that grace appear</p><br>
<p>The hour I first believed</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    ————————— Verse 3: ———————————————————————————————————————————————————</big></sup></h3>
<p> When we've been there, ten thousand years</p><br>
<p>Bright shining as the sun</p><br>
<p>We've no less days to sing Your praise</p><br>
<p>Than when we'd first begun</p><br>
