Should nothing of our efforts stand, no legacy survive
Unless the Lord does raise the house, in vain its builders strive.

To you who boast tomorrow's gain, tell me what is your life
A mist that vanishes at dawn, all glory be to Christ

We'll take a cup of kindness yet, all glory be to Christ

And we shall e'er His people be, all glory be to Christ
