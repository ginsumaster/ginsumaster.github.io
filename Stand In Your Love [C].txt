   ————————— Verse 1: ——————————————————————————————————————————
     C                              F
When darkness tries to roll over my bones
     C                               F
When sorrow comes to steal the joy I own
     Am                     G     F
When brokenness and pain is all I know
                  Am                      F
Oh, I won't be sha-ken, no, I won't be sha-ken

   ————————— Chorus: ———————————————————————————————————————————
   C                    G            F
My fear doesn't stand a chance when I  stand in Your love
   C                    G            F
My fear doesn't stand a chance when I  stand in Your love
   Am                   G            F                    C  G  (F)
My fear doesn't stand a chance when I  stand in Your love

C                              F
Shame no longer has a place to hide
C                         F
I am not a captive to the lies
    Am                     G      F
I'm not afraid to leave my past behind
                  Am                      F
Oh, I won't be sha-ken, no, I won't be sha-ken

        G                              Am
There's power that can break off every chain
        F                          C
There's power that can empty out a grave
        G                           Am
There's resurrection power that can save
                     F                    C      F
There's power in Your  name, power in Your  name
