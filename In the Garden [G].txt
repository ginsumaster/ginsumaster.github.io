   ————————— Verse 1: ——————————————————————————————————————————
  G                  D  G
I come to the garden a- lone,
          C      Am    C      G
While the dew is still on the roses
        D7                   G  D  G
And the voice I hear falling on my ear,
    A             D
The Son of God discloses

   ————————— Chorus 1: —————————————————————————————————————————
       G                     D7
And He walks with me, and He talks with me
       D7                G
And He tells me I am His own
        G      B7          Em    C
And the joy we share as we tarry there
     G         D    G
None other has ever known

   ————————— Verse 2: ——————————————————————————————————————————
   G                       D   G
He speaks and the sound of His voice
      C         Am    C          G
Is so sweet the birds hush their singing
        D7             G    D  G
And the melody that He gave to me
    A              D
Within my heart is ringing

   ————————— Verse 3: ——————————————————————————————————————————
    G                  D    G
I'd stay in the garden with Him
         C      Am    C     G
Tho' the night around me be falling
       D7                   G     D  G
But He bids me go thro' the voice of woe
    A              D
His voice to me is calling
