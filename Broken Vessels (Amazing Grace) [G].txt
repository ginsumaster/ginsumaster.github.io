   ————————— Verse 1: ——————————————————————————————————————————
          Em                G
All these pieces broken and scattered
         Em              G
In mercy gathered mended and whole
      Em                G
Empty handed but not forsaken
          D                  Em       D
I've been set free I've been set free

   ————————— Pre-Chorus 1: —————————————————————————————————————
 C                D
Amazing grace how sweet the sound
     Em                  C
That saved a wretch like me
                       D
Oh I once was lost but now I am found
    Em              C
Was blind but now I see

   ————————— Chorus: ———————————————————————————————————————————
                 G   D
Oh I can see You now
                 Em           C
Oh I can see the love in Your eyes
                G    D
Laying Yourself down
               Em        C
Raising up the broken to life
                          C  G

   ————————— Verse 2: ——————————————————————————————————————————
             Em                   G
You take our failure You take our weakness
             Em               G
You set Your treasure in jars of clay
             Em                      G
So take this heart Lord I'll be Your vessel
          D                Em    D
The world to see Your life in me (oh)

   ————————— Pre-Chorus 2: —————————————————————————————————————
 G                D
Amazing grace how sweet the sound
     Em                  C
That saved a wretch like me
     G                 D
Oh I once was lost but now I am found
    Em              C
Was blind but now I see
