   ————————— Verse 1: ——————————————————————————————————————————
   C                G
My hope is built on nothing less
C    F                G        C
Than Jesus' blood and righteousness;
  C                  G
I dare not trust the sweetest frame,
C   F              G      C
But wholly lean on Jesus' name.

   ————————— Refrain: ——————————————————————————————————————————
   C                 F
On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand;
    C                       G
All other ground is sinking sand,
G/F  C/E   F      C  G7      C
All  other ground is sinking sand.

   ————————— Verse 2: ——————————————————————————————————————————
     C                  G
When darkness veils His lovely face,
C  F             G        C
I  rest on His unchanging grace;
   C              G
In ev'ry high and stormy gale,
C  F                G      C
My anchor holds within the veil.

   ————————— Verse 3: ——————————————————————————————————————————
    C             G
His oath, His covenant, His blood
C  F              G        C
Support me in the whelming flood;
     C             G
When all around my soul gives way,
C  F              G        C
He then is all my hope and stay.

   ————————— Verse 4: ——————————————————————————————————————————
     C                  G
When He shall come with trumpet sound,
C   F             G      C
Oh, may I then in Him be found;
        C               G
Dressed in His righteousness alone,
C    F               G        C
Faultless to stand before the throne.
