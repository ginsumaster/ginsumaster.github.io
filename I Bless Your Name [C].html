<p>In pris'ners' chains,  with bleeding stripes,  Paul and Silas</p><br>
<p>Prayed that night  and in their pain  began to sing</p><br>
<p>Their chains were loosed  and they were free</p><br>
<br>

<p>I bless Your name,   I bless Your name</p><br>
<p>I give You honor, give You praise</p><br>
<p>You are the life,   the truth, the way</p><br>
<p>I bless Your name,  I bless Your name</p><br>

<p>Some midnight hour,  if you should find  you're in a prison</p><br>
<p>In your mind,   reach out and praise,  defy those chains</p><br>
<p>And they will fall   in Jesus' name</p><br>
<br>
