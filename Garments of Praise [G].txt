           G                           Gsus      G
Put on the garments of praise, for the spirit of heaviness
        D                     C              G
Let the oil of gladness flow, down from Your throne

Put on the garments of praise, for the spirit of heaviness

Your joy is my strength alone, my strength alone

   ————————— Chorus: ———————————————————————————————————————————
           C                  G/E
Make these broken weary bones rise to dance again
         C                           D
Wet this dry and thirsty land with a river
         C                                 Em
Lord our eyes are fixed on You, and we are waiting
         Am/C       C         D              C
For Your garland of grace, as we praise Your name
