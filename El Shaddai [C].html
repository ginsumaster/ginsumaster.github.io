<p>Through Your love and through the ram, You saved the Son of Abraham</p><br>
<p>Through the power of Your hand, You turned the sea into dry land</p><br>
<p>To the outcast on her knees, You were the God who really sees</p><br>
<p>And by Your might, You set Your children free</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Verse 2: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”</big></sup></h3>
<p>Through the years You made it clear, that the time of Christ was near</p><br>
<p>Though the people couldn't see, what Messiah ought to be</p><br>
<p>Though Your word contained the plan, they just could not understand</p><br>
<p>Your most awesome work was done, in the frailty of Your Son</p><br>
