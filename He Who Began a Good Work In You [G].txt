       G
If the struggle you're facing
   D/F#                  C/E         Am/C
Is slowly replacing your hope with despair
       D                           D                       G     D
Or the process is long, and you're losing your song in the night
G                         D/F#
You can be sure, that the Lord has His hand on you
C                        Am
Safe and secure, He will never abandon you
D                                                  G
You are His treasure, and He finds His pleasure in you
