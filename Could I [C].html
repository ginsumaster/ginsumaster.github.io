<h3><sup><big>    ————————— Verse 1 ————————————————————————————————————————————————————</big></sup></h3>
<p>Could I just sit here a while</p><br>
<p> Know that there's something that I need to say</p><br>
<p> Safe in the knowledge that You know my ways</p><br>
<p> Love me completely, no need to hide a thing</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    ————————— Verse 2: ———————————————————————————————————————————————————</big></sup></h3>
<p>Could I just sit here a while</p><br>
<p> Letting You melt away all of my fears</p><br>
<p> I feel Your comfort when You are so near</p><br>
<p> I'll hide myself in this shelter You've made for me</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    ————————— Bridge: ————————————————————————————————————————————————————</big></sup></h3>
<p> Could I, could I</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    ————————— Verse 3: ———————————————————————————————————————————————————</big></sup></h3>
<p>Could I just kneel here a while</p><br>
<p> Doing what I was created to do</p><br>
<p> Bowing in reverence I long to adore You</p><br>
<p> Willingly giving all that I can surrender</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    ————————— Verse 4: ———————————————————————————————————————————————————</big></sup></h3>
<p>Could I just rest here a while</p><br>
<p> Letting You whisper my burdens away</p><br>
<p> In all of my journeys there's no other place</p><br>
<p> Where I find refuge strength for my weary heart</p><br>
