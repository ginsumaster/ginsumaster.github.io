<h3><sup><big>    â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Verse 1: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”</big></sup></h3>
<p>I have made You too small in my eyes, O Lord forgive me</p><br>
<p>And I have believed in a lie  that You were unable to help me</p><br>
<p>But now, O Lord, I see my wrong  heal my heart and show Yourself strong</p><br>
<p>And in my eyes and in my song  O Lord, be magnified, O Lord, be magnified</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Chorus: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”</big></sup></h3>
<p>Be magnified, O Lord,  You are highly exalted</p><br>
<p> And there is nothing You can't do</p><br>
<p>O Lord, my eyes are on You</p><br>
<p>Be magnified, O Lord be magnified</p><br>

<h3><sup><big>    â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Verse 2: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”</big></sup></h3>
<p>I have leaned on the wisdom of men, O Lord,  forgive me</p><br>
<p>And I have responded to them  instead of Your light and Your mercy</p><br>
<p>But now, O Lord, I see my wrong  heal my heart and show Yourself strong</p><br>
<p>And in my eyes and in my song  O Lord, be magnified, O Lord, be magnified</p><br>
