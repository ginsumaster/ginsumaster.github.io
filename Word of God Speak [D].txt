   ————————— Verse 1: ——————————————————————————————————————————
              D                                   G
I'm finding myself  at a loss for words,  and the funny thing is,  it's okay.
                 D                             G
The last thing I need  is to be heard,  but to hear  what You would say.

   ————————— Chorus: ———————————————————————————————————————————
            D                               A
Word of God speak, would You pour down like rain,
           C                 G
Washing my eyes to see, Your majesty
            D                         A
To be still know, that You're in this place
              C                      G                     D      E:D
Please let me stay and rest, in Your Holiness. Word of God speak.

   ————————— Verse 2: ——————————————————————————————————————————
              D                                      G
I'm finding myself  in the midst of You,  beyond the music,  beyond the noise.
               D                                    G
And all that I need  is to be with You,  and in the quiet,  I hear Your voice.
