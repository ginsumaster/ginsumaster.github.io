The wind is beginning to blow, I can feel it, I can feel it.
The river is starting to flow, I can hear it, I can hear it.
These are the days,  the days of Your presence
Seasons of change,  times of refreshing

â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Chorus: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”
Over and over, let Your mercy cover me;
Over and over, let Your river run through me;
O, Holy Spirit, pour down like rain;
Over and over again
