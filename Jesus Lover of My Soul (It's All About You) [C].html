<h3><sup><big>    â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Chorus: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”</big></sup></h3>
<p>It's all about You  Jesus, and all this is for You</p><br>
<p>For Your glory and Your fame</p><br>
<p>It's not about me, as if You should do things my way</p><br>
<p>You alone are God, and I surrender, to Your ways</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Verse 1: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”</big></sup></h3>
<p>Jesus lover of my soul, all consuming fire is in Your gaze</p><br>
<p>Jesus, I want You to know, I will follow You all my days</p><br>
<p>For no one else in history is like You</p><br>
<p>And history itself belongs to You</p><br>
<p>Alpha and Omega, You have loved me</p><br>
<p>And I will spend eternity with You</p><br>
