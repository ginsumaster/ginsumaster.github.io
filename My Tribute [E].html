<h3><sup><big>    â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Verse 1: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”</big></sup></h3>
<p>How can I say thanks for the things that You have done for me?</p><br>
<p>Things so underserved, yet You give to prove Your love for me</p><br>
<p>The voices of a million angels could not express my gratitude</p><br>
<p>All that I am and ever hope to be, I owe it all to You</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Chorus: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”</big></sup></h3>
<p>To God be the glory, to God be the glory</p><br>
<p>To God  be the glory, for the things He has done</p><br>
<p>With His blood He has saved me</p><br>
<p>With His pow'r He has raised me</p><br>
<p>To God  be the glory, for the things He has done</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Bridge: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”</big></sup></h3>
<p>Just let me live my life and let it be pleasing Lord to Thee</p><br>
<p>And should I gain any praise let it go to Calvary</p><br>
<p>With His blood He has saved me</p><br>
<p>With His pow'r He has raised me</p><br>
<p>To God  be the glory, for the things He has done</p><br>
