Awake O Israel, put off thy slumber
        Dm                  A
And the truth shall set you free

For out of Zion comes thy Deliv'rer
       Bb      A7  Dm
In the year of jubilee

           Dm                Gm
Out of the furnace of much affliction
       Dm            A
I have chosen thee behold
           Dm              Gm
And so for iron, I'll give silver
        Bb         A7        Dm
And for brass I'll give thee gold

Thou art graven on My hand
           Dm                    Gm
And I will gather all those that gather
           Bb        A7       Dm
They shall come back to their land

O hallelujah, O hallelujah
