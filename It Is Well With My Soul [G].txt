   ————————— Verse 1: ——————————————————————————————————————————
     G             G/D      D7/A       G
When peace, like a river, attendeth my way,
     Em           Em/G  D/A     D     D7
When sorrows like sea   billows roll;
    G       C             Am           D
Whatever my lot, Thou has taught me to say,
      G/B         G/D   D7      G
It is well, it is well, with my soul.

   ————————— Refrain: ——————————————————————————————————————————
      G     D               G       C           G/D  D       G
It is well,   with my soul,   it is well, it is well with my soul.

       G            G/D            D7/A          G
Though Satan should buffet, though trials should come,
    Em           Em/G  D/A     D     D7
Let this blest assur-  ance control,
     G            C         Am         D
That Christ has regarded my helpless estate,
         G/B          G/D   D7     G
And hath shed His own blood for my soul.

   ————————— Verse 3: ——————————————————————————————————————————
   G            G/D           D7/A     G
My sin, oh, the bliss of this glorious thought!
   Em          Em/G  D/A     D      D7
My sin, not in part  but the whole,
   G             C            Am         D
Is nailed to the cross, and I bear it no more,
           G/B              G/D   D7   G
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul!

   ————————— Verse 4: ——————————————————————————————————————————
    G         G/D           D7/A            G
For me, be it Christ, be it Christ hence to live,
   Em      Em/G  D/A      D     D7
If Jordan above  me shall roll,
   G             C            Am          D
No pang shall be mine, for in death as in life
          G/B         G/D   D7    G
Thou wilt whisper Thy peace to my soul.

   ————————— Refrain: ——————————————————————————————————————————
      G     D               G       C           G/D  D       G
It is well,   with my soul,   it is well, it is well with my soul.

   ————————— Verse 5: ——————————————————————————————————————————
     G             G/D           D7/A      G
But, Lord, tis for Thee, for Thy coming we wait,
    Em           Em/G   D/A    D     D7
The sky, not the grave, is our goal;
   G            C         Am           D
Oh trump of the angel! Oh voice of the Lord!
        G/B           G/D  D7    G
Blessed hope, blessed rest of my soul!

   ————————— Verse 6: ——————————————————————————————————————————
    G               G/D         D7/A           G
And Lord, haste the day when my faith shall be sight,
    Em               Em/G  D/A  D       D7
The clouds be rolled back  as a scroll;
    G             C              Am           D
The trump shall resound, and the Lord shall descend,
     G/B       G/D  D7      G
Even so, it is well with my soul.

   ————————— Refrain: ——————————————————————————————————————————
      G     D               G       C           G/D  D       G
It is well,   with my soul,   it is well, it is well with my soul.
