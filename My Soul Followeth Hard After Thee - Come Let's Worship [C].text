Early in the morning will I rise up and seek Thee
And because, Thou, hast been my help
Under the shadow of Thy wing
I will rejoice

Come let's worship
Let's give our hearts to Him                           deserves
Let's give to Him,  all our praise, for that's what He deserves

The song that's in our hearts                   earth
Let His glory,  now be seen, throughout all the earth
