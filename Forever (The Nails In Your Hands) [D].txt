   ————————— Verse 1: ——————————————————————————————————————————
    D                        Bm7
The nails in Your hands, the nails in Your feet
G2                        Asus    A
They tell me how much You love me
    D                    Bm7
The thorns in Your brow, they tell me how
    G2                   Asus    A
You bore so much pain to love me

   ————————— Pre-Chorus: ———————————————————————————————————————
               F#m           Bm
Until when the heavens pass away
         F#m                Bm
All Your scars will still remain
       F#m            Bm
And forever they will say
     G            A
Just how much You love me
     G/A     A
So I want to say

   ————————— Chorus: ———————————————————————————————————————————
   D
Forever my love
   Bm7
Forever my heart
   G2              A
Forever my life is Yours
   ————————— Ending: ———————————————————————————————————————————
     D
It's Yours
