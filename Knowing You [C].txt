   ————————— Verse 1: ——————————————————————————————————————————
      Am   F    C              F    G  C
All I once held dear, built my life u- pon,
         Am    F  C/E       Am      Gsus  G
All this world re-veres and wars to own;
      F    G       C            F    G  C
All I once thought gain, I have counted loss;
          Am   F    C/E     Am       Gsus  G
Spent and worthless now, compared to this

   ————————— Chorus: ———————————————————————————————————————————
        F    C/E    F/A  GaddA/B  C
Knowing You, Jesus,      knowing  You,
      Am    Em/G    FaddG
There is no greater thing
F           C/E             F
  You're my all, You're the best,
          C/G              F
You're my joy, my righteousness,
      C/E      F2   C/G  Gsus  G
And I love You Lord

   ————————— Verse 2: ——————————————————————————————————————————
       Am      F  C          F    G   C
Now my heart's de-sire is to know You more,
      Am    F  C/E     Am       Gsus G
To be found in You and known as Yours;
      F    G  C            F     G   C
To possess by faith what I could not earn,
       Am  F   C/E     Am       Gsus  G
All surpassing gift of righteousness

   ————————— Verse 3: ——————————————————————————————————————————
       Am   F   C             F  G   C
Oh, to know the pow'r of Your ri-sen life
       Am   F   C/E     Am    Gsus  G
And to know You in Your sufferings;
     F    G    C           F      G  C
To become like You in Your death, my Lord,
        Am  F  C/E      Am    Gsus  G
So with You to live and never die
