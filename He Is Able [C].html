<p>He is able,  more than able</p><br>
<p>To accomplish what concens me today</p><br>
<p>He is able,  more than able</p><br>
<p>To handle anything that comes my way</p><br>
<p>He is able, more than able</p><br>
<p>To do much more than I could ever dream</p><br>
<p>He is able, more than able</p><br>
<p>To make me what He wants me to be</p><br>
<br>
<p>Variation: You are able ..</p><br>
