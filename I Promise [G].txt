G                   C  D   G              C  D
  Lord, You know my heart,   and all my desires
        Em     D           C       G     Am                 D
And the secret things I'll   never tell, Lord You know them well

   ————————— Verse 2: ——————————————————————————————————————————
G                 C  D   G                C  D

        Em       D          C      G         Am                D
That at times we like sheep   go astray, and things get out of hand

To live my life in purity, as unto You

Waiting for the day, when I hear You say
     C            G             Am   D   G   E: C  D  G  C  D  G
Here is the one I have created, just for you

  Until then, O Lord,   I will be content
        Em        D         C          G
Knowing that true love will   come someday
        Am             D
It will only come from You

   ————————— Bridge: ———————————————————————————————————————————
       Em              D               C     D        G
'Cause I have seen the suffering, that loneliness can cause
        Em                 D
When we choose to give our love away
    C               D
Without a righteous cause
