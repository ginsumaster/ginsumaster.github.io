<p>What gift of grace  is Jesus my redeemer  There is no more  for heaven now to give</p><br>

<br>
<h3><sup><big>    â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Chorus 1: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”</big></sup></h3>

<p>No fate I dread,  I know I am forgiven  The future sure,  the price it has been paid</p><br>
<p>For Jesus bled  and suffered for my pardon  And He was raised,  to overthrow the grave</p><br>
<br>

<p>Yet not I,  but through Christ  in me</p><br>
<br>

<p>With every breath,  I long to follow Jesus  For He has said,  that He will bring me home</p><br>
<p>And day by day,  I know He will renew me  Until I stand,  with joy before the throne</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Chorus 4: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”</big></sup></h3>
<p>To this I hold,  my hope is only Jesus  All the glory evermore to Him</p><br>
<p>When the race  is complete,  still my lips  shall repeat</p><br>
<p>Yet not I,  but through Christ  in me</p><br>
