<p>Give us ears to hear that still, small voice</p><br>
<p>And give us lips forever willing to rejoice</p><br>
<p>And may our eyes be lit with wisdom</p><br>
<p>May we know the path that's true</p><br>
<p>And we'll march with hearts courageous after You</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Chorus: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”</big></sup></h3>
<p>We're marching on,  with hearts courageous</p><br>
<p>We'll follow anywhere You want us to</p><br>
<p>And should You lead us where the battle rages</p><br>
<p>Let us march with hearts courageous after You</p><br>

<p>And when sorrow dims the light along the way</p><br>
<p>Help us to see each time of darkness through eyes of faith</p><br>
<p>A time for hope, a time for courage</p><br>
<p>Knowing You will lead us through</p><br>
<p>And we'll march with hearts courageous after You</p><br>
