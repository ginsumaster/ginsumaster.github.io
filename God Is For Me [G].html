<h3><sup><big>    ————————— Verse 1 ————————————————————————————————————————————————————</big></sup></h3>
<p> Looking out, it's a great big world,</p><br>
<p>Where do I go? How do I fit in?</p><br>
<p> Gotta keep this one thing on my mind,</p><br>
<p>Maker of all the universe is on my side.</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    ————————— Chorus —————————————————————————————————————————————————————</big></sup></h3>
<p>(And) if God is for me, who can be, who can be against me?</p><br>
<p>(And) if God is for me, who can be, who can be against me?</p><br>
<p> He is my strength, he is my friend forever.</p><br>
<p>(And) if God is for me, who can be, who can be against me?</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    ————————— Bridge —————————————————————————————————————————————————————</big></sup></h3>
<p> When I just don't understand, God is for me</p><br>
<p>When life doesn't go the way I planned. God is for me.</p><br>
