<p>O Lord my God, when I in awesome wonder</p><br>
<p>Consider all, the worlds Thy hands have made</p><br>
<p>I see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder</p><br>
<p>Thy pow'r throughout, the universe displayed</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Chorus: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”</big></sup></h3>
<p> Then sings my soul, my Savior God to Thee</p><br>

<p> Then sings my soul, my Savior God to Thee</p><br>
<p> How great Thou art,  how great Thou art</p><br>
<br>

<p>When thru the woods, and forest glades I wander</p><br>
<p>And hear the birds, sing sweetly in the trees</p><br>
<p>When I look down, from lofty mountain grandeur</p><br>
<p>And hear the brook, and feel the gentle breeze</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Verse 3: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”</big></sup></h3>
<p>And when I think, that God His Son not sparing</p><br>
<p>Sent Him to die, I scarce can take it in</p><br>
<p>That on the cross, my burden gladly bearing</p><br>
<p>He bled and died, to take away my sin</p><br>
<br>
<h3><sup><big>    â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€” Verse 4: â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”</big></sup></h3>
<p>When Christ shall come, with shout of acclamation</p><br>
<p>And take me home, what joy shall fill my heart</p><br>
<p>Then I shall bow, in humble adoration</p><br>
<p>And there proclaim, my God how great Thou art</p><br>
